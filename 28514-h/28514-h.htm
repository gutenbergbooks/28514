<h2><i>Friday the Eighth of March</i></h2>
</div>
<p>&#8220;But the thing I can&#8217;t understand, Dinky-Dunk,
is how you ever <i>could</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Could what?&#8221; my husband asked in an aerated
tone of voice.</p>
<p>I had to gulp before I got it out.</p>
<p>&#8220;Could kiss a woman like that,&#8221; I managed to explain.</p>
<p>Duncan Argyll McKail looked at me with a much
cooler eye than I had expected. If he saw my shudder,
he paid no attention to it.</p>
<p>&#8220;On much the same principle,&#8221; he quietly announced,
&#8220;that the Chinese eat birds&#8217; nests.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just what do you mean by that?&#8221; I demanded,
resenting the fact that he could stand as silent as a
December beehive before my morosely questioning
eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean that, being married, you&#8217;ve run away
with the idea that all birds&#8217; nests are made out of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2' name='page_2'></a>2</span>
mud and straw, with possibly a garnish of horse
hairs. But if you&#8217;d really examine these edible nests
you&#8217;d find they were made of surprisingly appealing
and succulent tendrils. They&#8217;re quite appetizing,
you may be sure, or they&#8217;d never be eaten!&#8221;</p>
<p>I stood turning this over, exactly as I&#8217;ve seen
my Dinkie turn over an unexpectedly rancid nut.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you, under the circumstances, being rather
stupidly clever?&#8221; I finally asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I suppose you&#8217;d rather see me cleverly
stupid?&#8221; he found the heart to suggest.</p>
<p>&#8220;But that woman, to me, always looked like a
frog,&#8221; I protested, doing my best to duplicate his
pose of impersonality.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, she doesn&#8217;t make love like a frog,&#8221; he retorted
with his first betraying touch of anger. I
turned to the window, to the end that my Eliza-Crossing-the-Ice
look wouldn&#8217;t be entirely at his
mercy. A belated March blizzard was slapping at
the panes and cuffing the house-corners. At the end
of a long winter, I knew, tempers were apt to be
short. But this was much more than a matter of
barometers. The man I&#8217;d wanted to live with like
a second &#8220;Suzanne de Sirmont&#8221; in Daudet&#8217;s <i>Happiness</i>
had not only cut me to the quick but was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3' name='page_3'></a>3</span>
rubbing salt in the wound. He had said what he
did with deliberate intent to hurt me, for it was only
too obvious that he was tired of being on the defensive.
And it did hurt. It couldn&#8217;t help hurting.
For the man, after all, was my husband. He was
the husband to whom I&#8217;d given up the best part of my
life, the two-legged basket into which I&#8217;d packed all
my eggs of allegiance. And now he was scrambling
that precious collection for a cheap omelette of amorous
adventure. He was my husband, I kept reminding
myself. But that didn&#8217;t cover the entire case.
No husband whose heart is right stands holding another
woman&#8217;s shoulder and tries to read her shoe-numbers
through her ardently upturned eyes. It
shows the wind is not blowing right in the home
circle. It shows a rent in the dyke, a flaw in the
blade, a breach in the fortress-wall of faith. For
marriage, to the wife who is a mother as well, impresses
me as rather like the spliced arrow of the
Esquimos: it is cemented together with blood. It
is a solemn matter. And for the sake of <i>mutter-schutz</i>,
if for nothing else, it must be kept that way.</p>
<p>There was a time, I suppose, when the thought of
such a thing would have taken my breath away,
would have chilled me to the bone. But I&#8217;d been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span>
through my refining fires, in that respect, and you
can&#8217;t burn the prairie over twice in the same season.
I tried to tell myself it was the setting, and not the
essential fact, that seemed so odious. I did my best
to believe it wasn&#8217;t so much that Duncan Argyll
McKail had stooped to make advances to this bandy-legged
she-teacher whom I&#8217;d so charitably housed at
Casa Grande since the beginning of the year&mdash;for
I&#8217;d long since learned not to swallow the antique
claim that of all terrestrial <i>carnivora</i> only man and
the lion are truly monogamous&mdash;but more the fact
it had been made such a back-stairs affair with no
solitary redeeming touch of dignity.</p>
<p>Dinky-Dunk, I suppose, would have laughed it
away, if I hadn&#8217;t walked in on them with their arms
about each other, and the bandy-legged one breathing
her capitulating sighs into his ear. But there
was desperation in the eyes of Miss Alsina Teeswater,
and it was plain to see that if my husband
had been merely playing with fire it had become
a much more serious matter with the lady in the
case. There was, in fact, something almost dignifying
in that strickenly defiant face of hers. I was
almost sorry for her when she turned and walked
white-lipped out of the room. What I resented most,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span>
as I stood facing my husband, was his paraded casualness,
his refusal to take a tragic situation tragically.
His attitude seemed to imply that we were
about to have a difference over a small thing&mdash;over
a small thing with brown eyes. He could even stand
inspecting me with a mildly amused glance, and I
might have forgiven his mildness, I suppose, if it had
been without amusement, and that amusement in
some way at my expense. He even managed to laugh
as I stood there staring at him. It was neither an
honest nor a natural laugh. It merely gave me the
feeling that he was trying to entrench himself behind
a raw mound of mirth, that any shelter was welcome
until the barrage was lifted.</p>
<p>&#8220;And what do you intend doing about it?&#8221; I asked,
more quietly than I had imagined possible.</p>
<p>&#8220;What would you suggest?&#8221; he parried, as he began
to feel in his pockets for his pipe.</p>
<p>And I still had a sense, as I saw the barricaded
look come into his face, of entrenchments being frantically
thrown up. I continued to stare at him as he
found his pipe and proceeded to fill it. I even wrung
a ghostly satisfaction out of the discovery that his
fingers weren&#8217;t so steady as he might have wished
them to be.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose you&#8217;re trying to make me feel like the
Wicked Uncle edging away from the abandoned
Babes in the Woods?&#8221; he finally demanded, as
though exasperated by my silence. He was delving
for matches by this time, and seemed disappointed
that none was to be found in his pockets. I don&#8217;t
know why he should seem to recede from me, for he
didn&#8217;t move an inch from where he stood with that
defensively mocking smile on his face. But abysmal
gulfs of space seemed to blow in like sea-mists between
him and me, desolating and lonely stretches
of emptiness which could never again be spanned by
the tiny bridges of hope. I felt alone, terribly alone,
in a world over which the last fire had swept and the
last rains had fallen. My throat tightened and my
eyes smarted from the wave of self-pity which washed
through my body. It angered me, ridiculously, to
think that I was going to break down at such a
time.</p>
<p>But the more I thought over it the more
muddled I grew. There was something maddening
in the memory that I was unable to act as my instincts
prompted me to act, that I couldn&#8217;t, like
the outraged wife of screen and story, walk promptly
out of the door and slam it epochally shut after me.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span>
But modern life never quite lives up to its fiction.
And we are never quite free, we women who have
given our hostages to fortune, to do as we wish. We
have lives other than our own to think about.</p>
<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s all been so&mdash;so <i>dishonest</i>!&#8221; I cried out,
stopping myself in the middle of a gesture which
might have seemed like wringing my hands.</p>
<p>That, apparently, gave Dinky-Dunk something to
get his teeth into. The neutral look went out of his
eye, to be replaced by a fortifying stare of enmity.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know as it&#8217;s any more dishonest than the
long-distance brand of the same thing!&#8221;</p>
<p>I knew, at once, what he meant. He meant Peter.
He meant poor old Peter Ketley, whose weekly letter,
year in and year out, came as regular as clockwork
to Casa Grande. Those letters came to my
son Dinkie, though it couldn&#8217;t be denied they carried
many a cheering word and many a companionable
message to Dinkie&#8217;s mother. But it brought me up
short, to think that my own husband would try to
play cuttle-fish with a clean-hearted and a clean-handed
man like Peter. The wave that went through
my body, on this occasion, was one of rage. I tried
to say something, but I couldn&#8217;t. The lion of my
anger had me down, by this time, with his paw on my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
breast. The power of speech was squeezed out of
my carcass. I could only stare at my husband with
a denuding and devastating stare of incredulity
touched with disgust, of abhorrence skirting dangerously
close along the margins of hate. And he
stared back, with morose and watchful defiance on
his face.</p>
<p>Heaven only knows how it would have ended, if
that tableau hadn&#8217;t gone smash, with a sudden offstage
clatter and thump and cry which reminded me
there were more people in the world than Chaddie
McKail and her philandering old husband. For
during that interregnum of parental preoccupation
Dinkie and Poppsy had essayed to toboggan down
the lower half of the front-stairs in an empty drawer
commandeered from my bedroom dresser. Their
descent, apparently, had been about as precipitate
as that of their equally adventurous sire down the
treads of my respect, for they had landed in a heap
on the hardwood floor of the hall and I found Dinkie
with an abraded shin-bone and Poppsy with a cut
lip. My Poppsy was more frightened at the sight
of blood than actually hurt by her fall, and Dinkie
betrayed a not unnatural tendency to enlarge on
his injuries in extenuation of his offense. But that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span>
suddenly imposed demand for first-aid took my mind
out of the darker waters in which it had been wallowing,
and by the time I had comforted my kiddies
and completed my ministrations Dinky-Dunk had
quietly escaped from the house and my accusatory
stares by clapping on his hat and going out to the
stables....</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s the scene which keeps pacing back and
forth between the bars of my brain like a jaguar in
a circus-cage. That&#8217;s the scene I&#8217;ve been living over,
for the last few days, thinking of all the more brilliant
things I might have said and the more expedient
things I might have done. And that&#8217;s the scene
which has been working like yeast at the bottom of
my sodden batter of contentment, making me feel
that I&#8217;d swell up and burst, if all that crazy ferment
couldn&#8217;t find some relief in expression. So after
three long years and more of silence I&#8217;m turning
back to this, the journal of one irresponsible old
Chaddie McKail, who wanted so much to be happy
and who has in some way missed the pot of gold
that they told her was to be found at the rainbow&#8217;s
end.</p>
<p>It seems incredible, as I look back, that more than
three, long years should slip away without the penning
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
of one line in this, the safety-valve of my soul.
But the impulse to write rather slipped away from
me. It wasn&#8217;t that there was so little to record, for
life is always life. But when it burns clearest it
seems to have the trick of consuming its own smoke
and leaving so very little ash. The crowded even
tenor of existence goes on, with its tidal ups and
downs, too listlessly busy to demand expression.
Then the shock of tempest comes, and it&#8217;s only after
we&#8217;re driven out of them that we realize we&#8217;ve been
drifting so long in the doldrums of life. Then it
comes home to us that there are the Dark Ages in
the history of a woman exactly as there were the
Dark Ages in the history of Europe. Life goes on
in those Dark Ages, but it doesn&#8217;t feel the call to
articulate itself, to leave a record of its experiences.
And that strikes me, as I sit here and think of it,
as about the deepest tragedy that can overtake anything
on this earth. Nothing, after all, is sadder
than silence, the silence of dead civilizations and dead
cities and dead souls. And nothing is more costly.
For beauty itself, in actual life, passes away, but
beauty lovingly recorded by mortal hands endures
and goes down to our children. And I stop writing,
at that word of &#8220;children,&#8221; for miraculously,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
as I repeat it, I see it cut a window in the unlighted
house of my heart. And that window is the bright
little Gothic oriel which will always be golden and
luminous with love and will always send the last
shadow scurrying away from the mustiest corner of
my tower of life. I have my Dinkie and my Poppsy,
and nothing can take them away from me. It&#8217;s on
them that I pin my hope.</p>

<a name='SUNDAY_THE_SEVENTEENTH' id='SUNDAY_THE_SEVENTEENTH'></a>
<h2><i>Sunday the Seventeenth</i></h2>
</div>
<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking a great deal over what&#8217;s happened
this last week or so. And I&#8217;ve been trying
to reorganize my life, the same as you put a house
to rights after a funeral. But it wasn&#8217;t a well-ordered
funeral, in this case, and I was denied even
the tempered satisfaction of the bereaved after the
finality of a smoothly conducted burial. For nothing
has been settled. It&#8217;s merely that Time has been
trying to encyst what it can not absorb. I felt, for
a day or two, that I had nothing much to live for.
I felt like a feather-weight who&#8217;d faced a knock-out.
I saw Pride go to the mat, and take the count, and
if I was dazed, for a while, I suppose it was mostly
convalescence from shock. Then I tightened my belt,
and reminded myself that it wasn&#8217;t the first wallop
Fate had given me, and remembered that in this life
you have to adjust yourself to your environment
or be eliminated from the game. And life, I suppose,
has tamed me, as a man who once loved me said it
would do. The older I get the more tolerant I try
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
to be, and the more I know of this world the more
I realize that Right is seldom all on one side and
Wrong on the other. It&#8217;s a matter of give and take,
this problem of traveling in double-harness. I can
even smile a little, as I remember that college day in
my teens when Matilda-Anne and Katrina and
Fanny-Rain-in-the-Face and myself solemnly discussed
man and his make-up, over a three-pound box
of Maillard&#8217;s, and resolutely agreed that we would
surrender our hearts to no suitor over twenty-six and
marry no male who&#8217;d ever loved another woman&mdash;not,
at least, unless the situation had become compensatingly
romanticized by the death of any such
lady preceding us in our loved one&#8217;s favor. Little
we knew of men and ourselves and the humiliations
with which life breaks the spirit of arrogant youth!
For even now, knowing what I know, I&#8217;ve been
doing my best to cooper together a case for my unstable
old Dinky-Dunk. I&#8217;ve been trying to keep
the thought of poor dead Lady Alicia out of my
head. I&#8217;ve been wondering if there&#8217;s any truth in
what Dinky-Dunk said, a few weeks ago, about a
mere father being like the male of the warrior-spider
whom the female of the species stands ready to dine
upon, once she&#8217;s assured of her progeny.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span></p>
<p>I suppose I <i>have</i> given most of my time and attention
to my children. And it&#8217;s as perilous, I suppose,
to give your heart to a man and then take it even
partly away again as it is to give a trellis to a
rose-bush and then expect it to stand alone. My
husband, too, has been restless and dissatisfied with
prairie life during the last year or so, has been rocking
in his own doldrums of inertia where the sight
of even the humblest ship&mdash;and the Wandering Sail
in this case always seemed to me as soft and shapeless
as a boned squab-pigeon!&mdash;could promptly elicit
an answering signal.</p>
<p>But I strike a snag there, for Alsina has not been
so boneless as I anticipated. There was an unlooked-for
intensity in her eyes and a mild sort of tragedy
in her voice when she came and told me that she
was going to another school in the Knee-Hill country
and asked if I could have her taken in to Buckhorn
the next morning. Some one, of course, had
to go. There was one too many in this prairie home
that must always remain so like an island dotting
the lonely wastes of a lonely sea. And triangles,
oddly enough, seem to flourish best in city squares.
But much as I wanted to talk to Alsina, I was compelled
to respect her reserve. I even told her that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
Dinkie would miss her a great deal. She replied,
with a choke in her voice, that he was a wonderful
child. That, of course, was music to the ears of his
mother, and my respect for the tremulous Miss
Teeswater went up at least ten degrees. But when
she added, without meeting my eye, that she was
really fond of the boy, I couldn&#8217;t escape the impression
that she was edging out on very thin ice. It
was, I think, only the silent misery in her half-averted
face which kept me from inquiring if she
hadn&#8217;t rather made it a family affair. But that,
second thought promptly told me, would seem too
much like striking the fallen. And we both seemed
to feel, thereafter, that silence was best.</p>
<p>Practically nothing passed between us, in fact,
until we reached the station. I could see that she
was dreading the ordeal of saying good-by. That
unnamed sixth sense peculiar to cab-drivers and
waiters and married women told me that every moment
on the bald little platform was being a torture
to her. As the big engine came lumbering up to a
standstill she gave me one quick and searching look.
It was a look I shall never forget. For, in it was
a question and something more than a question. An
unworded appeal was there, and also an unworded

protest. It got past my outposts of reason, in
some way. It came to me in my bitterness like the
smell of lilacs into a sick-room. I couldn&#8217;t be cruel
to that poor crushed outcast who had suffered quite
as much from the whole ignoble affair as I had suffered.
I suddenly held out my hand to her, and she
took it, with that hungry questioning look still on
her face.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right,&#8221; I started to say. But her head
suddenly went down between her hunched-up shoulders.
Her body began to shake and tears gushed
from her eyes. I had to help her to the car steps.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was all my fault,&#8221; she said in a strangled voice,
between her helpless little sobs.</p>
<p>It was brave of her, of course, and she meant it
for the best. But I wish she hadn&#8217;t said it. Instead
of making everything easier for me, as she intended,
she only made it harder. She left me disturbingly
conscious of ghostly heroisms which transposed
what I had tried to regard as essentially ignoble
into some higher and purer key. And she made it
harder for me to look at my husband, when I got
home, with a calm and collected eye. I felt suspiciously
like Lady Macbeth after the second murder.
I felt that we were fellow-sharers of a guilty secret
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
it would never do to drag too often into the light
of every-day life.</p>
<p>But it will no more stay under cover, I find, than
a dab-chick will stay under water. It bobs up in
the most unexpected places, as it did last night,
when Dinkie publicly proclaimed that he was going
to marry his Mummy when he got big.</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be well, my son, not to repeat the mistakes
of your father!&#8221; observed Dinky-Dunk. And
having said it, he relighted his quarantining pipe
and refused to meet my eye. But it didn&#8217;t take a
surgical operation to get what he meant into my
head. It hurt, in more ways than one, for it struck
me as suspiciously like a stone embodied in a snowball&mdash;and
even our offspring recognized this as no
fair manner of fighting.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then it impresses you as a mistake?&#8221; I demanded,
seeing red, for the coyote in me, I&#8217;m afraid, will
never entirely become house-dog.</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t that the way you regard it?&#8221; he asked, inspecting
me with a non-committal eye.</p>
<p>I had to bite my lip, to keep from flinging out at
him the things that were huddled back in my heart.
But it was no time for making big war medicine. So
I got the lid on, and held it there.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span></p>
<p>&#8220;My dear Dinky-Dunk,&#8221; I said with an effort at
a gesture of weariness, &#8220;I&#8217;ve long since learned that
life can&#8217;t be made clean, like a cat&#8217;s body, by the use
of the tongue alone!&#8221;</p>
<p>Dinky-Dunk did not look at me. Instead, he
turned to the boy who was watching that scene with
a small frown of perplexity on his none too approving
face.</p>
<p>&#8220;You go up to the nursery,&#8221; commanded my husband,
with more curtness than usual.</p>
<p>But before Dinkie went he slowly crossed the room
and kissed me. He did so with a quiet resoluteness
which was not without its tacit touch of challenge.</p>
<p>&#8220;You may feel that way about the use of the
tongue,&#8221; said my husband as soon as we were alone,
&#8220;but I&#8217;m going to unload a few things I&#8217;ve been keeping
under cover.&#8221;</p>
<p>He waited for me to say something. But I preferred
remaining silent.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; he floundered on, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to
stop you martyrizing yourself in making a mountain
out of a mole-hill. But I&#8217;m getting a trifle tired of
this holier-than-thou attitude. And&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And?&#8221; I prompted, when he came to a stop and
sat pushing up his brindled front-hair until it made
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
me think of the Corean lion on the library mantel,
the lion in pottery which we invariably spoke of as
the Dog of Fo. My wintry smile at that resemblance
seemed to exasperate him.</p>
<p>&#8220;What were you going to say?&#8221; I quietly inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, hell!&#8221; he exclaimed, with quite unexpected
vigor.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope the children are out of hearing,&#8221; I reminded
him, solemn-eyed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, the children!&#8221; he cried, catching at the
word exactly as a drowning man catches at a lifebelt.
&#8220;The children! That&#8217;s just the root of the
whole intolerable situation. This hasn&#8217;t been a home
for the last three or four years; it&#8217;s been nothing but
a nursery. And about all I&#8217;ve been is a retriever for
a <i>cr&egrave;che</i>, a clod-hopper to tiptoe about the sacred
circle and see to it there&#8217;s enough flannel to cover
their backs and enough food to put into their stomachs.
I&#8217;m an accident, of course, an intruder to be
faced with fortitude and borne with patience.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This sounds quite disturbing,&#8221; I interrupted. &#8220;It
almost leaves me suspicious that you are about to
emulate the rabbit and devour your young.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dinky-Dunk fixed me with an accusatory finger.</p>
<p>&#8220;And the fact that you can get humor out of it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
shows me just how far it has gone,&#8221; he cried with a
bitterness which quickly enough made me sober again.
&#8220;And I could stand being deliberately shut out of
your life, and shut out of their lives as far as you can
manage it, but I can&#8217;t see that it&#8217;s doing either them
or you any particular good.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I am responsible for the way in which those
children grow up,&#8221; I said, quite innocent of the
<i>double entendre</i> which brought a dark flush to my
husband&#8217;s none too happy face.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I suppose I&#8217;m not to contaminate them?&#8221;
he demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t you done enough along that line?&#8221; I
asked.</p>
<p>He swung about, at that, with something dangerously
like hate on his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whose children are they?&#8221; he challenged.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are their father,&#8221; I quietly acknowledged.
It rather startled me to find Dinky-Dunk regarding
himself as a fur coat and my offspring as moth-eggs
which I had laid deep in the pelt of his life, where
we were slowly but surely eating the glory out of that
garment and leaving it as bald as a prairie dog&#8217;s
belly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you give very little evidence of it!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t expect me to turn a cart-wheel, surely,
every time I remember it?&#8221; was my none too gracious
inquiry. Then I sat down. &#8220;But what is it you want
me to do?&#8221; I asked, as I sat studying his face, and I
felt sorriest for him because he felt sorry for himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s exactly the point,&#8221; he averred. &#8220;There
doesn&#8217;t seem anything to do. But this can&#8217;t go on
forever.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; I acknowledged. &#8220;It seems too much like
history repeating itself.&#8221;</p>
<p>His head went down, at that, and it was quite a
long time before he looked up at me again.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t suppose you can see it from my side of
the fence?&#8221; he asked with a disturbing new note of
humility in his voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not when you force me to stay on the fence,&#8221; I
told him. He seemed to realize, as he sat there
slowly moving his head up and down, that no further
advance was to be made along that line. So he took
a deep breath and sat up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Something will have to be done about getting a
new teacher for that school,&#8221; he said with an appositeness
which was only too painfully apparent.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve already spoken to two of the trustees,&#8221; I told
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
him. &#8220;They&#8217;re getting a teacher from the Peg. It&#8217;s
to be a man this time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Instead of meeting my eye, he merely remarked:
&#8220;That&#8217;ll be better for the boy!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In what way?&#8221; I inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because I don&#8217;t think too much petticoat is good
for any boy,&#8221; responded my lord and master.</p>
<p>&#8220;Big or little!&#8221; I couldn&#8217;t help amending, in spite
of all my good intentions.</p>
<p>Dinky-Dunk ignored the thrust, though it plainly
took an effort.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are times when even kindness can be a
sort of cruelty,&#8221; he patiently and somewhat platitudinously
pursued.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I wish somebody would ill-treat me along
that line,&#8221; I interjected. And this time he smiled,
though it was only for a moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Supposing we stick to the children,&#8221; he suggested.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; I agreed. &#8220;And since you&#8217;ve brought
the matter up I can&#8217;t help telling you that I always
felt that my love for my children is the one redeeming
thing in my life.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks,&#8221; said my husband, with a wince.</p>
<p>&#8220;Please don&#8217;t misunderstand me. I&#8217;m merely trying
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
to say that a mother&#8217;s love for her children has to
be one of the strongest and holiest things in this hard
old world of ours. And it seems only natural to me
that a woman should consider her children first, and
plan for them, and make sacrifices for them, and fight
for them if she has to.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s so natural, in fact,&#8221; remarked Dinky-Dunk,
&#8220;that it has been observed in even the Bengal tigress.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is my turn to thank you,&#8221; I acknowledged,
after giving his statement a moment or two of
thought.</p>
<p>&#8220;But we&#8217;re getting away from the point again,&#8221;
proclaimed my husband. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been trying to tell
you that children are like rabbits: It&#8217;s only fit and
proper they should be cared for, but they can&#8217;t thrive,
and they can&#8217;t even live, if they&#8217;re handled too much.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t observed any alarming absence of health
in my children,&#8221; I found the courage to say. But
a tightness gathered about my heart, for I could
sniff what was coming.</p>
<p>&#8220;They may be all right, as far as that goes,&#8221; persisted
their lordly parent. &#8220;But what I say is, too
much cuddling and mollycoddling isn&#8217;t good for that
boy of yours, or anybody else&#8217;s boy.&#8221; And he proceeded
to explain that my Dinkie was an ordinary,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
every-day, normal child and should be accepted and
treated as such or we&#8217;d have a temperamental little
bounder on our hands.</p>
<p>I knew that my boy wasn&#8217;t abnormal. But I knew,
on the other hand, that he was an exceptionally impressionable
and sensitive child. And I couldn&#8217;t be
sorry for that, for if there&#8217;s anything I abhor in this
world it&#8217;s torpor. And whatever he may have been,
nothing could shake me in my firm conviction that a
child&#8217;s own mother is the best person to watch over
his growth and shape his character.</p>
<p>&#8220;But what is all this leading up to?&#8221; I asked, steeling
myself for the unwelcome.</p>
<p>&#8220;Simply to what I&#8217;ve already told you on several
occasions,&#8221; was my husband&#8217;s answer. &#8220;That it&#8217;s
about time this boy of ours was bundled off to a
boarding-school.&#8221;</p>
<p>I sat back, trying to picture my home and my
life without Dinkie. But it was unbearable. It was
unthinkable.</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall never agree to that,&#8221; I quietly retorted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; asked my husband, with a note of triumph
which I resented.</p>
<p>&#8220;For one thing, because he is still a child, because
he is too young,&#8221; I contended, knowing that I could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
never agree with Dinky-Dunk in his thoroughly English
ideas of education even while I remembered how
he had once said that the greatness of England depended
on her public-schools, such as Harrow and
Eton and Rugby and Winchester, and that she had
been the best colonizer in the world because her boys
had been taken young and taught not to overvalue
home ties, had been made manlier by getting off
with their own kind instead of remaining hitched to
an apron-string.</p>
<p>&#8220;And you prefer keeping him stuck out here on
the prairie?&#8221; demanded Dinky-Dunk.</p>
<p>&#8220;The prairie has been good enough for his parents,
this last seven or eight years,&#8221; I contended.</p>
<p>&#8220;It hasn&#8217;t been good enough for me,&#8221; my husband
cried out with quite unlooked-for passion. &#8220;And
I&#8217;ve about had my fill of it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where would you prefer going?&#8221; I asked, trying
to speak as quietly as I could.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s something I&#8217;m going to find out as soon as
the chance comes,&#8221; he retorted with a slow and embittered
emphasis which didn&#8217;t add any to my peace of
mind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then why cross our bridges,&#8221; I suggested, &#8220;until
we come to them?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;re not looking for bridges,&#8221; he challenged.
&#8220;You don&#8217;t want to see anything beyond
living like Doukhobours out here on the edge of
Nowhere and remembering that you&#8217;ve got your
precious offspring here under your wing and wondering
how many bushels of Number-One-Hard it will
take to buy your Dinkie a riding pinto!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you rather tired to-night?&#8221; I asked with
all the patience I could command.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and I&#8217;m talking about the thing that makes
me tired. For you know as well as I do that you&#8217;ve
made that boy of yours a sort of anesthetic. You
put him on like a nose-cap, and forget the world.
He&#8217;s about all you remember to think about. Why,
when you look at the clock, nowadays, it isn&#8217;t ten
minutes to twelve. It&#8217;s always Dinkie minutes to
Dink. When you read a book you&#8217;re only reading
about what your Dinkie might have done or what
your Dinkie is some day to write. When you picture
the Prime Minister it&#8217;s merely your Dinkie grown
big, laying down the law to a House of Parliament
made up of other Dinkies, rows and rows of &#8217;em.
When the sun shines you&#8217;re wondering whether it&#8217;s
warm enough for your Dinkie to walk in, and when
the snow begins to melt you&#8217;re wondering whether
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
it&#8217;s soft enough for the beloved Dinkie to mold into
snowballs. When you see a girl you at once get
busy speculating over whether or not she&#8217;ll ever be
beautiful enough for your Dinkie, and when one of
the Crowned Heads of Europe announces the alliance
of its youngest princess you fall to pondering if
Dinkie wouldn&#8217;t have made her a better husband.
And when the flowers come out in your window-box
you wonder if they&#8217;re fair enough to bloom beside
your Dinkie. I don&#8217;t suppose I ever made a haystack
that you didn&#8217;t wonder whether it wasn&#8217;t going
to be a grand place for Dinkie to slide down. And
when Dinkie draws a goggle-eyed man on his scribbler
you see Michael Angelo totter and Titian turn
in his grave. And when Dinkie writes a composition
of thirty crooked lines on the landing of Hengist you
feel that fate did Hume a mean trick in letting him
pass away before inspecting that final word in historical
record. And heaven&#8217;s just a row of Dinkies
with little gold harps tucked under their wings. And
you think you&#8217;re breathing air, but all you&#8217;re breathing
is Dinkies, millions and millions of etherealized
Dinkies. And when you read about the famine in
China you inevitably and adroitly hitch the death
of seven thousand Chinks in Yangchow on to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
interests of your immortal offspring. And I suppose
Rome really came into being for the one ultimate end
that an immortal young Dinkie might possess his full
degree of Dinkiness and the glory that was Greece
must have been merely the tom-toms tuning up for
the finished dance of our Dinkie&#8217;s grandeur. Day
and night, it&#8217;s Dinkie, just Dinkie!&#8221;</p>
<p>I waited until he was through. I waited, heavy of
heart, until his foolish fires of revolt had burned
themselves out. And it didn&#8217;t seem to add to his
satisfaction to find that I could inspect him with a
quiet and slightly commiserative eye.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are accusing me,&#8221; I finally told him, &#8220;of
something I&#8217;m proud of. And I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;ll always
be guilty of caring for my own son.&#8221;</p>
<p>He turned on me with a sort of heavy triumph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s something that you&#8217;ll jolly well pay the
piper for, some day,&#8221; he announced.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean by that?&#8221; I demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean that nothing much is ever gained by letting
the maternal instinct run over. And that&#8217;s
exactly what you&#8217;re doing. You&#8217;re trying to tie
Dinkie to your side, when you can no more tie him
up than you can tie up a sunbeam. You could keep
him close enough to you, of course, when he was small.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
But he&#8217;s bound to grow away from you as he gets
bigger, just as I grew away from my mother and you
once grew away from yours. It&#8217;s a natural law, and
there&#8217;s no use crocking your knees on it. The boy&#8217;s
got his own life to live, and you can&#8217;t live it for him.
It won&#8217;t be long, now, before you begin to notice
those quiet withdrawals, those slippings-back into his
own shell of self-interest. And unless you realize
what it means, it&#8217;s going to hurt. And unless you
reckon on that in the way you order your life you&#8217;re
not only going to be a very lonely old lady but
you&#8217;re going to bump into a big hole where you
thought the going was smoothest!&#8221;</p>
<p>I sat thinking this over, with a ton of lead where
my heart should have been.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve already bumped into a big hole where I
thought the going was smoothest,&#8221; I finally observed.</p>
<p>My husband looked at me and then looked away
again.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was hoping we could fill that up and forget it,&#8221;
he ventured in a valorously timid tone which made it
hard, for reasons I couldn&#8217;t quite fathom, to keep
my throat from tightening. But I sat there, shaking
my head from side to side.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got to love something,&#8221; I found myself protesting.
&#8220;And the children seem all that is left.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How about me?&#8221; asked my husband, with his
acidulated and slightly one-sided smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve changed, Dinky-Dunk,&#8221; was all I could
say.</p>
<p>&#8220;But some day,&#8221; he contended, &#8220;you may wake up
to the fact that I&#8217;m still a human being.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve wakened up to the fact that you&#8217;re a different
sort of human being than I had thought.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, we&#8217;re all very much alike, once you get our
number,&#8221; asserted my husband.</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean men are,&#8221; I amended.</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean that if men can&#8217;t get a little warmth and
color and sympathy in the home-circle they&#8217;re going
to edge about until they find a substitute for it, no
matter how shoddy it may be,&#8221; contended Dinky-Dunk.</p>
<p>&#8220;But isn&#8217;t that a hard and bitter way of writing
life down to one&#8217;s own level?&#8221; I asked, trying to
swallow the choke that wouldn&#8217;t stay down in my
throat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I can&#8217;t see that we get much ahead by
trying to sentimentalize the situation,&#8221; he said, with
a gesture that seemed one of frustration.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span></p>
<p>We sat staring at each other, and again I had the
feeling of abysmal gulfs of space intervening between
us.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that all you can say about it?&#8221; I asked, with
a foolish little gulp I couldn&#8217;t control.</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it enough?&#8221; demanded Dinky-Dunk. And I
knew that nothing was to be gained, that night, by
the foolish and futile clash of words.</p>

<h2><i>Tuesday the Twenty-Third</i></h2>
</div>
<p>I&#8217;ve been doing a good deal of thinking over what
Dinky-Dunk said. I have been trying to see things
from his standpoint. By a sort of mental ju-jutsu
I&#8217;ve even been trying to justify what I can&#8217;t quite
understand in him. But it&#8217;s no use. There&#8217;s one
bald, hard fact I can&#8217;t escape, no matter how I dig
my old ostrich-beak of instinct under the sands of
self-deception. There&#8217;s one cold-blooded truth that
will have to be faced. <i>My husband is no longer in
love with me.</i> Whatever else may have happened, I
have lost my heart-hold on Duncan Argyll McKail.
I am still his wife, in the eyes of the law, and the
mother of his children. We still live together, and,
from force of habit, if from nothing else, go through
the familiar old rites of daily communion. He sits
across the table from me when I eat, and talks casually
enough of the trivially momentous problems of
the minute, or he reads in his slippers before the fire
while I do my sewing within a spool-toss of him. But
a row of invisible assegais stand leveled between his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
heart and mine. A slow glacier of green-iced indifferency
shoulders in between us; and gone forever
is the wild-flower aroma of youth, the singing spirit
of April, the mysterious light that touched our world
with wonder. He is merely a man, drawing on to
middle age, and I am a woman, no longer young.
Gone now are the spring floods that once swept us
together. Gone now is the flame of adoration that
burned clean our altar of daily intercourse and left
us blind to the weaknesses we were too happy to
remember. For there was a time when we loved
each other. I know that as well as Duncan does.
But it died away, that ghostly flame. It went out like
a neglected fire. And blowing on dead ashes can
never revive the old-time glow.</p>
<p>&#8220;So they were married and lived happy ever afterward!&#8221;
That is the familiar ending to the fairy-tales
I read over and over again to my Dinkie and
Poppsy. But they are fairy-tales. For who lives
happy ever afterward? First love chloroforms us,
for a time, and we try to hug to our bosoms the
illusion that Heaven itself is only a sort of endless
honeymoon presided over by Lohengrin marches.
But the anesthetic wears away and we find that life
isn&#8217;t a bed of roses but a rough field that rewards us
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
as we till it, with here and there the cornflower of
happiness laughing unexpectedly up at us out of our
sober acres of sober wheat. And often enough we
don&#8217;t know happiness when we see it. We assuredly
find it least where we look for it most. I can&#8217;t even
understand why we&#8217;re equipped with such a hunger
for it. But I find myself trending more and more
to that cynic philosophy which defines happiness as
the absence of pain. The absence of pain&mdash;that is
a lot to ask for, in this life!</p>
<p>I wonder if Dinky-Dunk is right in his implication
that I am getting hard? There are times, I know,
when I grate on him, when he would probably give
anything to get away from me. Yet here we are,
linked together like two convicts. And I don&#8217;t believe
I&#8217;m as hard as my husband accuses me of being.
However macadamized they may have made life for
me, there&#8217;s at least one soft spot in my heart, one
garden under the walls of granite. And that&#8217;s the
spot which my two children fill, which my children
keep green, which my children keep holy. It&#8217;s them
I think of, when I think of the future&mdash;when I should
at least be thinking a little of my grammar and
remembering that the verb &#8220;to be&#8221; takes the nominative,
just as discontented husbands seem to take
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
the initiative! That&#8217;s why I can&#8217;t quite find the
courage to ask for freedom. I have seen enough of
life to know what the smash-up of a family means to
its toddlers. And I want my children to have a
chance. They can&#8217;t have that chance without at
least two things. One is the guardianship of home
life, and the other is that curse of modern times
known as money. We haven&#8217;t prospered as we had
hoped to, but heaven knows I&#8217;ve kept an eagle eye
on that savings-account of mine, in that absurdly new
and resplendent red-brick bank in Buckhorn. Patiently
I&#8217;ve fed it with my butter and egg money,
joyfully I&#8217;ve seen it grow with my meager Nitrate
dividends, and grimly I&#8217;ve made it bigger with every
loose dollar I could lay my hands on. There&#8217;s no
heroism in my going without things I may have
thought I needed, just as there can be little nobility
in my sticking to a husband who no longer loves me.
For it&#8217;s not Chaddie McKail who counts now, but her
chicks. And I&#8217;ll have to look for my reward through
them, for I&#8217;m like Romanes&#8217; rat now, too big to get
into the bottle of cream, but wary enough to know
I can dine from a tail still small enough for insertion.
I&#8217;m merely a submerged prairie-hen with the best
part of her life behind her.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span></p>
<p>But it bothers me, what Duncan says about my
always thinking of little Dinkie first. And I&#8217;m
afraid I do, though it seems neither right nor fair.
I suppose it&#8217;s because he was my first-born&mdash;and
having come first in my life he must come first in my
thoughts. I was made to love somebody&mdash;and my
husband doesn&#8217;t seem to want me to love him. So
he has driven me to centering my thoughts on the
child. I&#8217;ve got to have something to warm up to.
And any love I may lavish on this prairie-chick of
mine, who has to face life with the lack of so many
things, will not only be a help to the boy, but will be
a help to me, the part of Me that I&#8217;m sometimes so
terribly afraid of.</p>
<p>Yet I can&#8217;t help wondering if Duncan has any
excuses for claiming that it&#8217;s personal selfishness
which prompts me to keep my boy close to my side.
And am I harming him, without knowing it, in keeping
him here under my wing? Schools are all right,
in a way, but surely a good mother can do as much in
the molding of a boy&#8217;s mind as a boarding-school
with a file of Ph.D.&#8217;s on its staff. But am I a good
mother? And should I trust myself, in a matter like
this, to my own feelings? Men, in so many things,
are better judges than women. Yet it has just
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
occurred to me that all men do not think alike. I&#8217;ve
been sitting back and wondering what kindly old
Peter would say about it. And I&#8217;ve decided to write
Peter and ask what he advises. He&#8217;ll tell the truth,
I know, for Peter is as honest as the day is long....</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve just been up to make sure the children were
properly covered in bed. And it disturbed me a
little to find that without even thinking about it I
went to Dinkie first. It seemed like accidental corroboration
of all that Duncan has been saying. But
I stood studying him as he lay there asleep. It
frightened me a little, to find him so big. If it&#8217;s true,
as Duncan threatens, that time will tend to turn
him away from me, it&#8217;s something that I&#8217;m going to
fight tooth and nail. And I&#8217;ve seen no sign of it, as
yet. With every month and every year that&#8217;s added
to his age he grows more companionable, more able
to bridge the chasm between two human souls. We
have more interests in common, more things to talk
about. And day by day Dinkie is reaching up to my
clumsily mature way of looking at life. He can
come to me with his problems, knowing I&#8217;ll always
give him a hearing, just as he used to come to me
with his baby cuts and bruises, knowing they would
be duly kissed and cared for. Yet some day, I have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
just remembered, he may have problems that can&#8217;t
be brought to me. But that day, please God, I shall
defer as long as possible. Already we have our own
little secrets and private compacts and understandings.
I don&#8217;t want my boy to be a mollycoddle. But
I want him to have his chance in the world. I want
him to be somebody. I can&#8217;t reconcile myself to the
thought of him growing up to wear moose-mittens
and shoe-packs and stretching barb-wire in blue-jeans
and riding a tractor across a prairie back-township.
I refuse to picture him getting bent and
gray wringing a livelihood out of an over-cropped
ranch fourteen miles away from a post-office and a
world away from the things that make life most worth
living. If he were an ordinary boy, I might be led
to think differently. But my Dinkie is not an ordinary
boy. There&#8217;s a spark of the unusual, of the
exceptional, in that laddie. And I intend to fan
that spark, whatever the cost may be, until it breaks
out into genius.</p>

<h2><i>Sunday the Twenty-Eighth</i></h2>
</div>
<p>I&#8217;ve had scant time for introspection during the
last five days, for Struthers has been in bed with
lumbago, and the weight of the housework reverted
to me. But Whinstane Sandy brought his precious
bottle of Universal Ointment in from the bunk-house,
and while that fiery mixture warmed her lame back,
the thought of its origin probably warmed her lonely
heart. I have suddenly wakened up to the fact that
Struthers is getting on a bit. She is still the same
efficient and self-obliterating mainstay of the kitchen
that she ever was, but she grows more &#8220;sot&#8221; in her
ways, more averse to any change in her daily routine,
and more despairing of ever finally and completely
capturing that canny old Scotsman whom we still so
affectionately designate as Whinnie, in short for
Whinstane Sandy. Whinnie, I&#8217;m afraid, still nurses
the fixed idea that everything in petticoats and as yet
unwedded is after him. And it is only by walking
with the utmost circumspection that he escapes their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
wiles and by maintaining an unbroken front withstands
their unseemly advances.</p>
<p>The new school-teacher has arrived, and is to live
with us here at Casa Grande. I have my reasons for
this. In the first place, it will be a help to Dinkie in
his studies. In the second place, it means that the
teacher can pack my boy back and forth to school,
in bad weather, and next month when Poppsy joins
the ranks of the learners, can keep a more personal
eye on that little tot&#8217;s movements. And in the third
place the mere presence of another male at Casa
Grande seems to dilute the acids of home life.</p>
<p>Gershom Binks is the name of this new teacher, and
I have just learned that in the original Hebrew
&#8220;Gershom&#8221; not inappropriately means &#8220;a stranger
there.&#8221; He is a sophomore (a most excellent word,
that, when you come to inquire into its etymology!)
from the University of Minnesota and is compelled to
teach the young idea, for a time, to accumulate sufficient
funds to complete his course, which he wants
to do at Ann Arbor. And Gershom is a very tall
and very thin and very short-sighted young man,
with an Adam&#8217;s apple that works up and down with
a two-inch plunge over the edge of his collar when he
talks&mdash;which he does somewhat extensively. He wears
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
glasses with big bulging lenses, glasses which tend to
hide a pair of timid and brown-October-aleish eyes
with real kindliness in them. He looks ill-nourished,
but I can detect nothing radically wrong with his
appetite. It&#8217;s merely that, like Cassius, he thinks too
much. And I&#8217;m going to fatten that boy up a bit,
before the year is out, or know the reason why. He
may be a trifle self-conscious and awkward, but he&#8217;s
also amazingly clean of both body and mind, and it
will be no hardship, I know, to have him under our
roof. And for all his devotion to Science, he reads
his Bible every night&mdash;which is more than Chaddie
McKail does! He rather took the wind out of my
sails by demanding, the first morning at breakfast,
if I knew that one half-ounce of the web of the spider&mdash;the
arachnid of the order <i>Araneida</i>, he explained&mdash;if
stretched out in a straight line would reach from
the city of Chicago to the city of Paris. I told him
that this was a most wonderful and a most interesting
piece of information and hoped that some day we
could verify it by actual test. Yet when I inquired
whether he meant merely the environs of the city of
Paris, or the very heart of the city such as the Place
de l&#8217;Op&eacute;ra, he studied me with the meditative eye
with which Huxley must have once studied beetles.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span></p>
<p>Dinky-Dunk, I notice, is as restive as a bull-moose
in black-fly season. He&#8217;s doing his work on the land,
as about every ranch-owner has to, whether he&#8217;s happily
married or not, but he&#8217;s doing it without any
undue impression of its epical importance. I heard
him observe, yesterday, that if he could only get his
hands on enough ready money he&#8217;d like to swing into
land business in a live center like Calgary. He has
a friend there, apparently, who has just made a
clean-up in city real estate and bought his wife a
Detroit Electric and built a home for himself that
cost forty thousand dollars. I reminded Dinky-Dunk,
when he had finished, that we really must have
a new straining-mesh in the milk-separator. He
merely looked at me with a sour and morose eye as
he got up and went out to his team.</p>
<p>Surely these men-folks are a dissatisfied lot! Gershom
to-night complained that his own name of
&#8220;Gershom Binks&#8221; impressed him as about the ugliest
name that was ever hitched on to a scholar and a
gentlemen. And later on, after I&#8217;d opened my piano
and tried to console myself with a tu&#8217;penny draught
of Grieg, he inspected the instrument and informed
me that it was really evolved from the six-stringed
harps of the fourth Egyptian dynasty, which in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
fifth dynasty was made with a greatly enlarged base,
thus giving the rudimentary beginning of a soundboard.</p>
<p>I am learning a lot from Gershom! And so are my
kiddies, for that matter. I begin, in fact, to feel
like royalty with a private tutor, for every night
now Dinkie and Poppsy and Gershom sit about the
living-room table and drink of the founts of wisdom.
But we have a teacher here who loves to teach. And
he is infinitely patient and kind with my little toddlers.
Dinkie already asks him questions without
number, while Poppsy gratefully but decorously
vamps him with her infantine gazes. Then Gershom&mdash;Heaven
bless his scholastic old high-browed solemnity&mdash;has
just assured me that Dinkie betrays many
evidences of an exceptionally bright mind.</p>

<h2><i>Friday the Second</i></h2>
</div>
<p>My husband yesterday accused me of getting moss-backed.
He had been harping on the city string
again and asked me if I intended to live and die a
withered beauty on a back-trail ranch.</p>
<p>That &#8220;withered beauty&#8221; hurt, though I did my
best to ignore it, for the time at least. And Dinky-Dunk
went on to say that it struck him as one of
life&#8217;s little ironies that <i>I</i> should want to stick to the
sort of life we were leading, remembering what I&#8217;d
come from.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dinky-Dunk,&#8221; I told him, &#8220;it&#8217;s terribly hard to
explain exactly how I feel about it all. I suppose I
could never make you see it as I see it. But it&#8217;s a
feeling like loyalty, loyalty to the land that&#8217;s given us
what we have. And it&#8217;s also a feeling of disliking to
see one old rule repeating itself: what has once been
a crusade becoming merely a business. To turn and
leave our land now, it seems to me, would make us
too much like those soulless soil-robbers you used to
rail at, like those squatters who&#8217;ve merely squeezed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
out what they could and have gone on, like those land-miners
who take all they can get and stand ready to
put nothing back. Why, if we were all like that,
we&#8217;d have no country here. We&#8217;d be a wilderness, a
Barren Grounds that went from the Border up to the
Circle. But there&#8217;s something bigger than that about
it all. I love the prairie. Just why it is, I don&#8217;t
know. It&#8217;s too fundamental to be fashioned into
words, and I never realized how deep it was until I
went back to the city that time. One can just say
it, and let it go at that: <i>I love the prairie.</i> It isn&#8217;t
merely its bigness, just as it isn&#8217;t altogether its freedom
and its openness. Perhaps it&#8217;s because it keeps
its spirit of the adventurous. I love it the same as my
children love <i>The Arabian Nights</i> and <i>The Swiss
Family Robinson</i>. I thought it was mostly cant,
once, that cry about being next to nature, but the
more I know about nature the more I feel with Pope
that naught but man is vile, to speak as impersonally,
my dear Diddums, as the occasion will permit. I&#8217;m
afraid I&#8217;m like that chickadee that flew into the bunk-house
and Whinnie caught and put in a box-cage
for Dinkie. I nearly die at the thought of being
cooped up. I want clean air and open space about
me.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I never dreamed you&#8217;d been Indianized to that
extent,&#8221; murmured my husband.</p>
<p>&#8220;Being Indianized,&#8221; I proceeded, &#8220;seems to carry
the inference of also being barbarized. But it isn&#8217;t
quite that, Dinky-Dunk, for there&#8217;s something almost
spiritually satisfying about this prairie life if you&#8217;ve
only got the eyes to see it. I think that&#8217;s because the
prairie always seems so majestically beautiful to me.
I can see your lip curl again, but I know I&#8217;m right.
When I throw open my windows of a morning and
see that placid old never-ending plain under its great
wash of light something lifts up in my breast, like a
bird, and no matter how a mere man has been doing
his best to make me miserable that something stands
up on the tip of my heart and does its darnedest to
sing. It impresses me as life on such a sane and
gigantic scale that I want to be an actual part of it,
that I positively ache to have a share in its immensities.
It seems so fruitful and prodigal and generous
and patient. It&#8217;s so open-handed in the way it produces
and gives and returns our love. And there&#8217;s a
completeness about it that makes me feel it can&#8217;t
possibly be wrong.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Eskimo, I suppose, feels very much the same
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
in his little igloo of ice with a pot of whale-blubber
at his elbow,&#8221; observed my husband.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a brute, my dear Diddums, and more
casually cruel than a Baffin-land cannibal,&#8221; I retorted.
&#8220;But we&#8217;ll let it pass. For I&#8217;m talking about
something that&#8217;s too fundamental to be upset by a
bitter tongue. There was a time, I know, when I used
to fret about the finer things I thought I was losing
out of life, about the little hand-made fripperies
people have been forced to conjure up and carpenter
together to console them for having to live in human
beehives made of steel and concrete. But I&#8217;m beginning
to find out that joy isn&#8217;t a matter of geography
and companionship isn&#8217;t a matter of over-crowded
subways. And the strap-hangers and the train-catchers
and the first-nighters can have what they&#8217;ve
got. I don&#8217;t seem to envy them the way I used to. I
don&#8217;t need a Louvre when I&#8217;ve got the Northern
Lights to look at. And I can get along without an
&AElig;olian Hall when I&#8217;ve got a little music in my own
heart&mdash;for it&#8217;s only what you&#8217;ve got there, after all,
that really counts in this world!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All of which means,&#8221; concluded my husband, &#8220;that
you are most unmistakably growing old!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You have already,&#8221; I retorted, &#8220;referred to me
as a withered beauty.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dinky-Dunk studied me long and intently. I even
felt myself turning pink under that prolonged stare
of appraisal.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are still easy to look at,&#8221; he over-slangily
and over-generously admitted. &#8220;But I do regret that
you aren&#8217;t a little easier to live with!&#8221;</p>
<p>I could force a little laugh, at that, but I couldn&#8217;t
quite keep a tremor out of my voice when I spoke
again.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry you see only my bad side, Dinky-Dunk.
But it&#8217;s kindness that seems to bring everything that
is best out of us women. We&#8217;re terribly like sliced
pineapple in that respect: give us just a sprinkling
of sugar, and out come all the juices!&#8221;</p>
<p>It was Dinky-Dunk&#8217;s color that deepened a little
as he turned and knocked out his pipe.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a Chaddie McKail argument,&#8221; he merely
observed as he stood up. &#8220;And a Chaddie McKail
argument impresses me as suspiciously like Swiss
cheese: it doesn&#8217;t seem to be genuine unless you can
find plenty of holes in it.&#8221;</p>
<p>I did my best to smile at his humor.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But this isn&#8217;t an argument,&#8221; I quietly corrected.
&#8220;I&#8217;d look at it more in the nature of an ultimatum.&#8221;</p>
<p>That brought him up short, as I had intended it
to do. He stood worrying over it as Bobs and
Scotty worry over a bone.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid,&#8221; he finally intoned, &#8220;I&#8217;ve been repeatedly
doing you the great injustice of underestimating
your intelligence!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; I told him, &#8220;is a point where I find silence
imposed upon me.&#8221;</p>
<p>He didn&#8217;t speak until he got to the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m glad we&#8217;ve cleared the air a bit anyway,&#8221;
he said with a grim look about his Holbein Astronomer
old mouth as he went out.</p>
<p>But we haven&#8217;t cleared the air. And it disturbs me
more than I can say to find that I have reservations
from my husband. It bewilders me to see that I can&#8217;t
be perfectly candid with him. But there are certain
deeper feelings that I can no longer uncover in his
presence. Something holds me back from explaining
to him that this fixed dread of mine for all cities is
largely based on my loss of little Pee-Wee. For if
I hadn&#8217;t gone to New York that time, to Josie Langdon&#8217;s
wedding, I might never have lost my boy. They
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
did the best they could, I suppose, before their telegrams
brought me back, but they didn&#8217;t seem to
understand the danger. And little did I dream,
before the Donnelly butler handed me that first
startling message just as we were climbing into the
motor to go down to the Rochambeau to meet Chinkie
and Tavvy, that within a week I was to sit and watch
the cruelest thing that can happen in this world. I
was to see a small child die. I was to watch my own
Pee-Wee pass quietly away.</p>
<p>I have often wondered, since, why I never shed a
tear during all those terrible three days. I couldn&#8217;t,
in some way, though the nurse herself was crying, and
poor old Whinnie and Struthers were sobbing together
next to the window, and dour old Dinky-Dunk,
on the other side of the bed, was racking his shoulders
with smothered sobs as he held the little white hand
in his and the warmth went forever out of the little
fingers where his foolish big hand was trying to hold
back the life that couldn&#8217;t be kept there. The old
are ready to die, or can make themselves ready. They
have run their race and had their turn at living. But
it seems cruel hard to see a little tot, with eagerness
still in his heart, taken away, taken away with the
wonder of things still in his eyes. It stuns you. It
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
makes you rebel. It leaves a scar that Time itself
can never completely heal.</p>
<p>Yet through it all I can still hear the voice of
valorous old Whinnie as he patted my shoulder and
smiled with the brine still in the seams of his furrowed
old face. &#8220;We&#8217;ll thole through, lassie; we&#8217;ll thole
through!&#8221; he said over and over again. Yes; we&#8217;ll
thole through. And this is only the uncovering of
old wounds. And one must keep one&#8217;s heart and one&#8217;s
house in order, for with us we still have the living.</p>
<p>But Dinky-Dunk can&#8217;t completely understand,
I&#8217;m afraid, this morbid hankering of mine to keep
my family about me, to have the two chicks that are
left to me close under my wing. And never once, since
Pee-Wee went, have I actually punished either of my
children. It may be wrong, but I can&#8217;t help it. I
don&#8217;t want memories of violence to be left corroding
and rankling in my mind. And I&#8217;d hate to see any
child of mine cringe, like an ill-treated dog, at every
lift of the hand. There are better ways of controlling
them, I begin to feel, than through fear. Their
father, I know, will never agree with me on this matter.
He will always insist on mastery, open and
undisputed mastery, in his own house. He is the
head of this Clan McKail, the sovereign of this little
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
circle. For we can say what we will about democracy,
but when a child is born unto a man that man unconsciously
puts on the purple. He becomes the ruler
and sits on the throne of authority. He even seeks
to cloak his weaknesses and his mistakes in that
threadbare old fabrication about the divine right of
kings. But I can see that he is often wrong, and
even my Dinkie can see that he is not always right in
his decrees. More and more often, of late, I&#8217;ve observed
the boy studying his father, studying him with
an impersonal and critical eye. And this habit of
silent appraisal is plainly something which Duncan
resents, and resents keenly. He&#8217;s beginning to have a
feeling, I&#8217;m afraid, that he can&#8217;t quite get <i>at</i> the boy.
And there&#8217;s a youthful shyness growing up in Dinkie
which seems to leave him ashamed of any display of
emotion before his father. I can see that it even
begins to exasperate Duncan a little, to be shut out
behind those incontestable walls of reserve. It&#8217;s
merely, I&#8217;m sure, that the child is so terribly afraid
of ridicule. He already nurses a hankering to be
regarded as one of the grown-ups and imagines
there&#8217;s something rather babyish in any undue show
of feeling. Yet he is hungry for affection. And he
aches, I know, for the approbation of his male parent,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
for the approval of a full-grown man whom he can
regard as one of his own kind. He even imitates his
father in the way in which he stands in front of the
fire, with his heels well apart. And he gives me chills
up the spine by pulling short on one bridle-rein and
making Buntie, his mustang-pony, pirouette just as
the wicked-tempered Briquette sometimes pirouettes
when his father is in the saddle. Yet Dinky-Dunk&#8217;s
nerves are a bit ragged and there are times when he&#8217;s
not always just with the boy, though it&#8217;s not for me
to confute what the instinctive genius of childhood
has already made reasonably clear to Dinkie&#8217;s discerning
young eye. But I can not, of course, encourage
insubordination. All I can do is to ignore the
unwelcome and try to crowd it aside with happier
things. I want my boy to love me, as I love him.
And I think he does. I <i>know</i> he does. That knowledge
is an azure and bottomless lake into which I
can toss my blackest pebbles of fear, my flintiest
doubts of the future.</p>

<h2><i>Sunday the Fourth</i></h2>
</div>
<p>I wish I could get by the scruff of the neck that
sophomoric old philosopher who once said nothing
survives being thought of. For I&#8217;ve been learning,
this last two or three days, just how wide of the
mark he shot. And it&#8217;s all arisen out of Dinky-Dunk&#8217;s
bland intimation that I am &#8220;a withered
beauty.&#8221; Those words have held like a fish-hook in
the gills of my memory. If they&#8217;d come from somebody
else they mightn&#8217;t have meant so much. But
from one&#8217;s own husband&mdash;Wow!&mdash;they go in like a
harpoon. And they have given me a great deal to
think about. There are times, I find, when I can
accept that intimation of slipping into the sere and
yellow leaf without revolt. Then the next moment it
fills me with a sort of desperation. I refuse to go up
on the shelf. I see red and storm against age. I
refuse to bow to the inevitable. My spirit recoils
at the thought of decay. For when you&#8217;re fading
you&#8217;re surely decaying, and when you&#8217;re decaying
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
you&#8217;re approaching the end. So stop, Father Time,
stop, or I&#8217;ll get out of the car!</p>
<p>But we can&#8217;t get out of the car. That&#8217;s the tragic
part of it. We have to go on, whether we like it or
not. We have to buck up, and grin and bear it, and
make the best of a bad bargain. And Heaven knows
I&#8217;ve never wanted to be one of the Glooms! I&#8217;ve no
hankering to sit with the Sob Sisters and pump
brine over the past. I&#8217;m light-hearted enough if
they&#8217;ll only give me a chance. I&#8217;ve always believed in
getting what we could out of life and looking on the
sunny side of things. And the disturbing part of it
is, I don&#8217;t <i>feel</i> withered&mdash;not by a jugful! There
are mornings when I can go about my homely old
duties singing like a prairie Tetrazzini. There are
days when I could do a hand-spring, if for nothing
more than to shock my solemn old Dinky-Dunk out
of his dourness. There are times when we go skimming
along the trail with the crystal-cool evening
air in our faces and the sun dipping down toward the
rim of the world when I want to thank Somebody I
can&#8217;t see for Something-or-other I can&#8217;t define. <i>Dum
vivimus vivamus.</i></p>
<p>But it seems hard to realize that I&#8217;m a sedate and
elderly lady already on the shady side of thirty. A
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
woman over thirty years old&mdash;and I can remember
the days of my intolerant youth when I regarded the
woman of thirty as an antiquated creature who should
be piously preparing herself for the next world. And
it doesn&#8217;t take thirty long to slip into forty. And
then forty merges into fifty&mdash;and there you are, a
nice old lady with nervous indigestion and knitting-needles
and a tendency to breathe audibly after
ascending the front-stairs. No wonder, last night, it
drove me to taking a volume of George Moore down
from the shelf and reading his chapter on &#8220;The
Woman of Thirty.&#8221; But I found small consolation
in that over-uxorious essay, feeling as I did that I
knew life quite as well as any amorous studio-rat
who ever made copy out of his mottled past. So I
was driven, in the end, to studying myself long and
intently in the broken-hinged mirrors of my dressing-table.
And I didn&#8217;t find much there to fortify my
quailing spirit. I was getting on a bit. I was curling
up a little around the edges. There was no denying
that fact. For I could see a little fan-light of lines
at the outer corner of each eye. And down what
Dinky-Dunk once called the honeyed corners of my
mouth went another pair of lines which clearly came
from too much laughing. But most unmistakably of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
all there was a line coming under my chin, a small but
tell-tale line, announcing the fact that I wasn&#8217;t losing
any in weight, and standing, I suppose, one of the
foot-hills which precede the Rocky-Mountain dewlaps
of old age. It wouldn&#8217;t be long, I could see, before
I&#8217;d have to start watching my diet, and looking for
a white hair or two, and probably give up horseback
riding. And then settle down into an ingle-nook old
dowager with a hassock under <i>my</i> feet and a creak in
my knees and a fixed conviction that young folks
never acted up in <i>my</i> youth as they act up nowadays.</p>
<p>I tried to laugh it away, but my heart went down
like a dredge-dipper. Whereupon I set my jaw,
which didn&#8217;t make me look any younger. But I didn&#8217;t
much care, for the mirror had already done its worst.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not muchee!&#8221; I said as I sat there making faces
at myself. &#8220;You&#8217;re still one of the living. The
bloom may be off in a place or two, but you&#8217;re sound
to the core, and serviceable for many a year. So
<i>sursum corda! &#8216;Rung ho! Hira Singh!</i>&#8217; as Chinkie
taught us to shout in the old polo days. And that
means, Go in and win, Chaddie McKail, and die with
your boots on if you have to.&#8221;</p>
<p>I was still intent on that study of my robust-looking
but slightly weather-beaten map when Dinky-Dunk
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
walked in and caught me in the middle of my
Narcissus act.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;All is vanity saith the Preacher,&#8217;&#8221; he began.
But he stopped short when I swung about at him.
For I hadn&#8217;t, after all, been able to carpenter together
even a whale-boat of consolation out of my
wrecked schooner of hope.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Kakaibod,&#8221; I wailed, &#8220;I&#8217;m a pie-faced old has-been,
and nobody will ever love me again!&#8221;</p>
<p>He only laughed, on his way out, and announced
that I seemed to be getting my share of loving, as
things went. But he didn&#8217;t take back what he said
about me being withered. And the first thing I shall
do to-morrow, when Gershom comes down to breakfast,
will be to ask him how old Cleopatra was when
she brought Antony to his knees and how antiquated
Ninon D&#8217;Enclos was when she lost her power over
that semi-civilized creature known as Man. Gershom
will know, for Gershom knows everything.</p>

<a name='WEDNESDAY_THE_SEVENTH' id='WEDNESDAY_THE_SEVENTH'></a>
<h2><i>Wednesday the Seventh</i></h2>
</div>
<p>Gershom has been studying some of my carbon-prints.
He can&#8217;t for the life of him understand why
I consider Dewing&#8217;s <i>Old-fashioned Gown</i> so beautiful,
or why I should love Childe Hassam&#8217;s <i>Church at Old
Lyme</i> or see anything remarkable about Metcalf&#8217;s
<i>May Night</i>. But I cherish them as one cherishes
photographs of lost friends.</p>
<p>A couple of the Horatio Walker&#8217;s, he acknowledged,
seemed to mean something to him. But Gershom&#8217;s
still in the era when he demands a story in
the picture and could approach Monet and Degas
only by way of Meissonier and Bouguereau. And a
print, after all, is only a print. He&#8217;s slightly ashamed
to admire beauty as mere beauty, contending that at
the core of all such things there should be a moral.
So we pow-wowed for an hour and more over the
threadbare old theme and the most I could get out
of Gershom was that the lady in <i>The Old-fashioned
Gown</i> reminded him of me, only I was more vital.
But all that talk about landscape and composition
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
and line and tone made me momentarily homesick for a
glimpse of Old Lyme again, before I go to my reward.</p>
<p>But the mood didn&#8217;t last. And I no longer regret
what&#8217;s lost. I don&#8217;t know what mysterious Divide
it is I have crossed over, but it seems to be peace I
want now instead of experience. I&#8217;m no longer envious
of the East and all it holds. I&#8217;m no longer
fretting for wider circles of life. The lights may be
shining bright on many a board-walk, at this moment,
but it means little to this ranch-lady. What I want
now is a better working-plan for that which has
already been placed before me. Often and often, in
the old days, when I realized how far away from the
world this lonely little island of Casa Grande and its
inhabitants stood, I used to nurse a ghostly envy for
the busier tideways of life from which we were banished.
I used to feel that grandeur was in some way
escaping me. I could picture what was taking place
in some of those golden-gray old cities I had known:
The Gardens of the Luxembourg when the horse-chestnuts
were coming out in bloom, and the Ch&acirc;teau
de Madrid in the Bois at the luncheon hour, or the
Pre Catalan on a Sunday with heavenly sole in lemon
and melted butter and a still more heavenly waltz as
you sat eating <i>fraises des bois</i> smothered in thick
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
<i>cr&ecirc;me d&#8217;Isigny</i>. Or the Piazzi di Spagna on Easter
Sunday with the murmur of Rome in your ears and
the cars and carriages flashing through the green-gold
shadows of the Pincio. Or Hyde Park in May,
with the sun sifting through the brave old trees and
flashing on the helmets of the Life Guards as the King
goes by in a scarlet uniform with the blue Order of
the Garter on his breast, or Park Lane on a glorious
light-and-shadow afternoon in June and a dip into
the familiar old Americanized clangor at the Cecil;
or Chinkie&#8217;s place in Devonshire about a month
earlier, sitting out on the terrace wrapped in
steamer-rugs and waiting for the moon to come up
and the first nightingale to sing. Of Fifth Avenue
shining almost bone-white in the clear December sunlight
and the salted nuts and orange-blossom cocktails
at Sherry&#8217;s, or the Plaza tea-room at about
five o&#8217;clock in the afternoon with the smell of Turkish
tobacco and golden pekoe and hot-house violets and
Houbigant&#8217;s <i>Quelque-fleurs</i> all tangled up together.
Or the City of Wild Parsley in March with a wave
of wild flowers breaking over the ruins of Selinunte
and the tumbling pillars of the Temple of Olympian
Zeus lying time-mellowed in the clear Sicilian sunlight!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span></p>
<p>They were all lovely enough, and still are, I suppose,
but it&#8217;s a loveliness in some way involved with
youth. So the memory of those far-off gaieties,
which, after all, were so largely physical, no longer
touch me with unrest. They&#8217;re wine that&#8217;s drunk and
water that&#8217;s run under the bridge. Younger lips can
drink of that cup, which was sweet enough in its time.
Let the newer girls dance their legs off under the
French crystals of the Ritz, and powder their noses
over the Fountain of the Sunken Boat, and eat the
numbered duck so reverentially doled out at La Tour
d&#8217;Argent and puff their cigarettes behind the beds of
begonias and marguerites at the Ch&acirc;teau Madrid.
They too will get tired of it, and step aside for others.
For the petal falls from the blossom and the blossom
plumps out into fruit. And all those golden girls,
when their day is over, must slip away from those
gardens of laughter. When they don&#8217;t, they only
make themselves ridiculous. For there&#8217;s nothing
sadder than an antique lady of other days decking
herself out in the furbelows of a lost youth. And I&#8217;ve
got Dinky-Dunk&#8217;s overalls to patch and my bread to
set, so I can&#8217;t think much more about it to-night.
But after I&#8217;ve done my chores, and before I go up to
bed, I&#8217;m going to read <i>Rabbi Ben Ezra</i> right through
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
to the end. I&#8217;ll do it in front of the fire, with my
feet up and with three Ontario Northern Spy apples
on a plate beside me, to be munched as Audrey herself
might have munched them, oblivious of any
Touchstone and his reproving eyes.</p>
<p>I have stopped to ponder, however, how much of
this morbid dread of mine for big cities is due to
that short and altogether unsatisfactory visit to New
York, to that sense of coming back a stranger and
finding old friends gone and those who were left with
such entirely new interests.</p>
<p>I was out of it, completely and dishearteningly out
of it. And my clothes were all wrong. My hats
were wrong; my shoes were wrong; and every rag I
had on me was in some way wrong. I was a tourist
from the provinces. And I wasn&#8217;t up-to-date with
either what was on me or was <i>in</i> me. I didn&#8217;t even
know the new subway routes or the telephone rules or
the proper places to go for tea. The Metropolitan
looked cramped and shoddy and <i>Tristan</i> seemed shoddily
sung to me. There was no thrill to it. And
even <i>The Jewels of the Madonna</i> impressed me as a
bit garish and off color, with the Apache Dance of
the last act almost an affront to God and man. I
even asked myself, when I found that I had lost the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
trick of laughing at bridal-suite farces, if it was the
possession of children that had changed me. For
when you&#8217;re with children you must in some way
match their snowy innocence with a kindred coloring
of innocence, very much as the hare and the weasel
and the ptarmigan turn white to match the whiteness
of our northern winter. Yet I was able to wring pure
joy out of Rachmaninoff&#8217;s playing at Carnegie Hall,
with a great man making music for music&#8217;s sake. I
loved the beauty and balance and splendid sanity of
that playing, without keyboard fire-works and dazzle
and glare. But Rachmaninoff was the exception.
Even Central Park seemed smaller than of old, and I
couldn&#8217;t remember which drives Dinky-Dunk and I
had taken in the historic old hansom-cab after our
equally historic marriage by ricochet. Fifth Avenue
itself was different, the caterpillar of trade having
crawled a little farther up the stalk of fashion, for
the shops, I found, went right up to the Park, and
the old W. K. house where we once danced our long-forgotten
Dresden China Quadrille, in imitation of
the equally forgotten Eighty-Three event, confronted
me as a beehive of business offices. I couldn&#8217;t quite
get used to the new names and the new faces and the
new shops and the side-street theaters and the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
thought of really nice girls going to a prize-fight in
Madison Square Garden, and the eternal and never-ending
talk about drinks, about where and how to
get them, and how to mix them, and how much
Angostura to put into &#8217;em, and the musty ale that
used to be had at Losekam&#8217;s in Washington, and the
<i>Beaux Arts</i> cocktails that used to come with a dash
of absinthe, and the shipment of pinch-neck Scotch
which somebody smuggled in on his cruiser-yacht
from the east end of Cuba, and so-forth and so-forth
until I began to feel that the only important thing in
the world was the possession and dispensation of
alcohol. And out of it I got the headache without
getting the fun. I had the same dull sense of being
cheated which came to me in my flapper days when
I fell asleep with a mouthful of contraband gum and
woke up in the morning with my jaw-muscles tired&mdash;I&#8217;d
been facing all the exertion without getting any
of the satisfaction.</p>
<p>The one bright spot to me, in that lost city of my
childhood, was the part of Madison Avenue which
used to be known as Murray Hill, the right-of-way
along the west sidewalk of which I once commandeered
for an afternoon&#8217;s coasting. I could see again, as I
glanced down the familiar slope, the puffy figure of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
old Major Elmes, who in those days was always pawing
somebody, since he seemed to believe with Novalis
that he touched heaven when he placed his hand on a
human body. I could see myself sky-hooting down
that icy slope on my coaster, approaching the old
Major from the rear and peremptorily piping out:
&#8220;One side, please!&#8221; For I was young then, and I
expected all life to make way for me. But the old
Major betrayed no intention of altering his solemnly
determined course at any such juvenile suggestion,
with the result that he sat down on me bodily, and
for the next two blocks approached his club in Madison
Square in a manner and at a speed which he had
in no wise anticipated. But, <i>Eheu</i>, how long ago it
all seemed!</p>

<h2><i>Saturday the Tenth</i></h2>
</div>
<p>Peter has written back in answer to my question
as to the expediency of sending my boy off to a
boarding-school. He put all he had to say in two
lines. They were:</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>I had a mother like Dinkie&#8217;s, I&#8217;d stick to her
until the stars were dust.</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>That was very nice of Peter, of course, but I don&#8217;t
imagine he had any idea of the peck of trouble he
was going to stir up at Casa Grande. For Dinky-Dunk
picked up the sheet of paper on which that
light-hearted message had been written and perused
the two lines, perused them with a savagery which
rather disturbed me. He read them for the second
time, and then he put them down. His eye, as he
confronted me, was a glacial one.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too bad we can&#8217;t run this show without the
interference of outsiders,&#8221; he announced as he stalked
out of the room.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking the thing over, and trying to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
get my husband&#8217;s view-point. But I can&#8217;t quite succeed.
There has always been a touch of the satyric
in Dinky-Dunk&#8217;s attitude toward Peter&#8217;s weekly
letter to my boy. He has even intimated that they
were written in a new kind of Morse, the inference
being that they were intended to carry messages in
cipher to eyes other than Dinkie&#8217;s. But Peter is
much too honest a man for any such resort to subterfuge.
And Dinky-Dunk has always viewed with
a hostile eye the magazines and books and toys which
big-hearted Peter has showered out on us. Peter
always was ridiculously open-handed. And he always
loved my Dinkie. And it&#8217;s only natural that our
thoughts should turn back to where our love has
been left. Peter, I know, gets quite as much fun out
of those elaborately playful letters to Dinkie as
Dinkie does himself. And it&#8217;s left the boy more
anxious to learn, to the end that he may pen a more
respectable reply to them.</p>
<p>Some of Peter&#8217;s gifts, it is true, have been embarrassingly
ornate, but Peter, who has been given so
much, must have remembered how little has come to
my kiddies. It was my intention, for a while, to talk
this over with Dinky-Dunk, to try to make him see
it in a more reasonable light. But I have now given
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
up that intention. There&#8217;s a phantasmal something
that holds me back....</p>
<p>I dreamt last night that my little Dinkie was a
grown youth in a Greek academy, wearing a toga
and sitting on a marble bench overlooking a sea of
lovely sapphire. There both Peter and Percy, also
arrayed in togas, held solemn discourse with my offspring
and finally agreed that once they were through
with him he would be the Wonder of the Age....</p>
<p>Dinky-Dunk asked me point-blank to-day if I&#8217;d
consider the sale of Casa Grande, provided he got
the right price for the ranch. I felt, for a moment,
as though the bottom had been knocked out of my
world. But it showed me the direction in which my
husband&#8217;s thoughts have been running of late. And
I just as pointedly retorted that I&#8217;d never consent
to the sale of Casa Grande. It&#8217;s not merely because
it&#8217;s our one and only home. It&#8217;s more because of the
little knoll where the four Manitoba maples have
been set and the row of prairie-roses have been
planted along the little iron fence, the little iron
fence which twice a year I paint a virginal white,
with my own hands. For that&#8217;s where my Pee-Wee
sleeps, and that lonely little grave must never pass
out of my care, to be forgotten and neglected and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
tarnished with time. It&#8217;s not a place of sorrow now,
but more an altar, duly tended, the flower-covered
bed of my Pee-Wee, of my poor little Pee-Wee who
was so brimming with life and love. He used to make
me think of a humming-bird in a garden&mdash;and now
all I have left of him is my small chest of toys and
trinkets and baby-clothes. God, I know, will be
good to that lonely little newcomer in His world of
the statelier dead, in His gallery of whispering
ghosts. Oh, be good to him, God! Be good to him,
or You shall be no God of mine! I can&#8217;t think of
him as dead, as going out like a candle, as melting
into nothingness as the little bones under their six
feet of earth molder away. But my laddie is gone.
And I must not be morbid. As Peter once said,
misery loves company, but the company is apt to
seek more convivial quarters. Yet something has
gone out of my life, and that something drives me
back to my Dinkie and my Poppsy with a sort of
fierceness in my hunger to love them, to make the
most of them.</p>
<p>Gershom, who has been giving Poppsy a daily
lesson at home, has just inquired why she shouldn&#8217;t
be sent to school along with Dinkie. And her father
has agreed. It gave me the wretched feeling, for a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
moment or two, that they were conspiring to take
my last baby away from me. But I have to bow
to the fact that I no longer possess one, since Poppsy
announced her preference, the other day, for a doll
&#8220;with real livings in it.&#8221; She begins to show as
fixed an aversion to baby-talk as that entertained by
old Doctor Johnson himself, and no longer yearns
to &#8220;do yidin on the team-tars,&#8221; as she used to express
it. The word &#8220;birthday&#8221; is still &#8220;birfday&#8221; with her,
and &#8220;water&#8221; is still &#8220;wagger,&#8221; but she now religiously
eschews all such reiterative diminutives as
&#8220;roundy-poundy&#8221; and &#8220;Poppsy-Woppsy&#8221; and
&#8220;beddy-bed.&#8221; She has even learned, after much
effort, to convert her earlier &#8220;keam of feet&#8221; into
the more legitimate and mature &#8220;cream of wheat.&#8221;
And now that she has a better mastery of the sibilants
the charm has rather gone out of the claim,
which I so laboriously taught her, that &#8220;Daddy is
all feet,&#8221; meaning, of course, that he was altogether
sweet&mdash;which he gave small sign of being when he
first caught the point of my patient schooling. She
is not so quick-tongued as her brother Dinkie, but
she has a natural fastidiousness which makes her
long for alignment with the proprieties. She is, in
fact, a conformist, a sedate and dignified little lady
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
who will never be greatly given to the spilling of
beans and the upsetting of apple-carts. She is, in
many ways, amazingly like her pater. She will, I
know, be a nice girl when she grows up, without very
much of that irresponsibility which seems to have
been the bugbear of her maternal parent. I&#8217;m even
beginning to believe there&#8217;s something in the old tradition
about ancestral traits so often skipping a
generation. At any rate, that crazy-hearted old
Irish grandmother of mine passed on to me a muckle
o&#8217; her wildness, the mad County Clare girl who
swore at the vicar and rode to hounds and could
take a seven-barred gate without turning a hair and
was apt to be always in love or in debt or in hot
water. She died too young to be tamed, I&#8217;m told, for
say what you will, life tames us all in the end. Even
Lady Hamilton took to wearing red-flannel petticoats
before she died, and Buffalo Bill faded down
into plain Mr. William Cody, and the abducted Helen
of Troy gave many a day up to her needlework, we
are told, and doubtlessly had trouble with both her
teeth and her waist measurement.</p>
<p>Dinky-Dunk is proud of his Poppsy and has announced
that it&#8217;s about time we tucked the &#8220;Poppsy&#8221;
away with her baby-clothes and resorted to the use
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
of the proper and official &#8220;Pauline Augusta.&#8221; So
Pauline we shall try to have it, after this. There are
several things, I think, which draw Dinky-Dunk and
his Poppsy&mdash;I mean his Pauline&mdash;together. One is
her likeness to himself. Another is her tractability,
though I hate to hitch so big a word on to so small
a lady. And still another is the fact that she is a
girl. There&#8217;s a subliminal play of sex-attraction
about it, I suppose, just as there probably is between
Dinkie and me. And there&#8217;s something very
admirable in Pauline Augusta&#8217;s staid adoration of
her dad. She plays up to him, I can see, without
quite knowing she&#8217;s doing it. She&#8217;s hungry for his
approval, and happiest, always, in his presence.
Then, too, she makes him forget, for the time at
least, his disappointment in a soul-mate who hasn&#8217;t
quite measured up to expectations! And I devoutly
thank the Master of Life and Love that my solemn
old Dinky-Dunk can thus care for his one and only
daughter. It softens him, and keeps the sordid
worries of the moment from vitrifying his heart. It
puts a rainbow in his sky of every-day work, and
gives him something to plan and plot and live for.
And he needs it. We all do. It&#8217;s our human and
natural hunger for companionship. And as he observed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
not long ago, if that hunger can&#8217;t be satisfied
at home, we wander off and snatch what we can
on the wing. Some day when they&#8217;re rich, I overheard
Dinky-Dunk announcing the other night,
Pauline Augusta and her Dad are going to make
the Grand Tour of Europe. And there, undoubtedly,
do their best to pick up a Prince of the Royal
Blood and have a ch&acirc;teau in Lombardy and a villa
on the Riviera and a standing invitation to all the
Embassy Balls!</p>
<p>Well, not if I know it. None of that penny-a-liner
moonshine for my daughter. And as she grows
older, I feel sure, I&#8217;ll have more influence over her.
She&#8217;ll begin to realize that the battle of life hasn&#8217;t
scarred up for nothing this wary-eyed old mater
who&#8217;s beginning to know a hawk from a henshaw.
I&#8217;ve learned a thing or two in my day, and one or
two of them are going to be passed on to my offspring.</p>

<h2><i>Thursday the Fifteenth</i></h2>
</div>
<p>Struthers and I have been house-cleaning, for
this is the middle of May, and our reluctant old
northern spring seems to be here for good. It has
been backward, this year, but the last of the mud
has gone, and I hope to have my first setting of
chicks out in a couple of days. Dinkie wants to
start riding Buntie to school, but his pater says
otherwise. Gershom goes off every morning, with
Calamity Kate hitched to the old buckboard, with
my two kiddies packed in next to him and provender
enough for himself and the kiddies and Calamity
Kate under the seat. The house seems very empty
when they are away. But some time about five,
every afternoon, I see them loping back along the
trail. Then comes the welcoming bark of old Bobs,
and a raid on the cooky-jar, and traces of bread-and-jelly
on two hungry little faces, and the familiar
old tumult about the reanimated rooms of Casa
Grande. Then Poppsy&mdash;I beg her ladyship&#8217;s pardon,
for I mean, of course, Pauline Augusta&mdash;has
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
to duly inspect her dolls to assure herself that they
are both well-behaved and spotless as to apparel,
for Pauline Augusta is a stickler as to decorum and
cleanliness; and Dinkie falls to working on his air-ship,
which he is this time making quite independent
of Whinnie, whose last creation along that line betrayed
a disheartening disability for flight. But
even this second effort, I&#8217;m afraid, is doomed to
failure, for more than once I&#8217;ve seen Dinkie back
away and stand regarding his incompetent flier with
a look of frustration on his face. He is always
working over machinery&mdash;for he loves anything with
wheels&mdash;and I&#8217;m pretty well persuaded that the
twentieth-century mania of us grown-ups for picking
ourselves to pieces is nothing more than a development
of this childish hunger to get the cover off
things and see the works go round. Dinkie makes
wagons and carts and water-wheels, but some common
fatality of incompetence overtakes them all and
they are cast aside for enterprises more novel and
more promising. He announces, now, that he intends
to be an engineer. And that recalls the time when
I was convinced in my own soul that he was destined
for a life of art, since he was forever asking me to
draw him &#8220;a li&#8217;l&#8217; man,&#8221; and later on fell to drawing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
them himself. He would do his best to inscribe a
circle and then emboss it with perfectly upright hair,
as though the person in question had just been perusing
the most stirring of penny-dreadfuls. Then
he would put in two dots of eyes, and one abbreviated
and vertical line for the nose, and another elongated
and horizontal line for the mouth, and arms with
extended and extremely elocutionary fingers, to say
nothing of extremely attenuated legs which invariably
toed-out, to make more discernible the silhouette
of the ponderously booted feet. I have several
dozen of these &#8220;li&#8217;l&#8217; men&#8221; carefully treasured in
an old cigar-box. But he soon lost interest in these
purely anthropocentric creations and broadened out
into the delineation of boats and cars and wheel-barrows
and rocking-chairs and tea-pots, lying along
the floor on his stomach for an hour at a time, his
tongue moving sympathetically with every movement
of his pencil. He held the latter clutched close to the
point by his stubby little fingers.</p>
<p>I had to call a halt on all such artistry, however,
for he startled me, one day, by suddenly going crosseyed.
It came, of course, from working with his
nose too close to the paper. I imagined, with a sinking
heart, that it was an affliction which was to stay
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
with him for the rest of his natural life. But a
night&#8217;s sleep did much to restore the over-taxed eye-muscles
and before the end of a week they had entirely
righted themselves.</p>
<p>To-morrow Dinkie will probably want to be an
aeronaut, and the next day a cowboy, and the next
an Indian scout, for I notice that his enthusiasms
promptly conform to the stimuli with which he
chances to be confronted. Last Sunday he asked
me to read Macaulay&#8217;s <i>Horatius</i> to him. I could
see, after doing so, that it was going to his head
exactly as a second Clover-Club cocktail goes to the
head of a sub-deb. On Tuesday, when I went out
about sun-down to get him to help me gather the
eggs, I found that he had made a sword by nailing
a bit of stick across a slat from the hen-house, and
also observed that he had possessed himself of my
boiler-top. So I held back, slightly puzzled. But
later on, hearing much shouting and clouting and
banging of tin, I quietly investigated and found
Dinkie in the corral-gate, holding it against all
comers. So earnest was he about it, so rapt was he
in that solemn business of warfare, that I decided
to slip away without letting him see me. He was
sixteen long centuries away from Casa Grande, at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
that moment. He was afar off on the banks of the
Tiber, defending the Imperial City against Lars
Porsena and his footmen. All Rome was at his back,
cheering him on, and every time his hen-coop slat
thumped that shredded old poplar gate-post some
proud son of Tuscany bit the dust.</p>

<h2><i>Sunday the Twenty-Fifth</i></h2>
</div>
<p>Duncan, it&#8217;s plain to see, is still in the doldrums.
He is uncommunicative and moody and goes about
his work with a listlessness which is more and more
disturbing to me. He surprised his wife the other
day by addressing her as &#8220;Lady Selkirk,&#8221; for the
simple reason, he later explained, that I propose to
be monarch of all I survey, with none to dispute my
domain. And a little later he further intimated that
I was like a miser with a pot of gold, satisfied to
live anywhere so long as my precious family-life
could go clinking through my fingers.</p>
<p>That was last Sunday&mdash;a perfect prairie day&mdash;when
I sat out on the end of the wagon-box, watching
Poppsy and Dinkie. I sat in the warm sunlight,
in a sort of trance, staring at those two children as
they went about their solemn business of play. They
impressed me as two husky and happy-bodied little
beings and I remembered that whatever prairie-life
had cost me, it had not cost me the health of my
family. My two bairns had been free of those illnesses
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
and infections which come to the city child,
and I was glad enough to remember it. But I was
unconscious of Dinky-Dunk&#8217;s cynic eye on me as I
sat there brooding over my chicks. When he spoke
to me, in fact, I was thinking how odd it was that
Josie Langdon, on the very day before her marriage,
should have carried me down to the lower end of
Fifth Avenue and led me into the schoolroom of the
Church of the Ascension, and asked me to study
Sorolla&#8217;s <i>Triste Herencia</i> which hangs there.</p>
<p>I can still see that wonderful canvas where the foreshore
of Valencia, usually so vivacious with running
figures and the brightest of sunlight on dancing sails,
had been made the wine-dark sea of the pagan questioner
with the weight of immemorial human woe to
shadow it. Josie had been asking me about marriage
and children, for even she was knowing her more
solemn moments in the midst of all that feverishly
organized merriment. But I was surprised, when she
slipped a hand through my arm, to see a tear run
down her nose. So I looked up again at Sorolla&#8217;s
picture of the naked little cripples snatching at their
moment&#8217;s joy along the water&#8217;s edge, at his huddled
group of maimed and cast-off orphans trying to be
happy without quite knowing how. I can still see the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
stunted little bodies, naked in sunlight that seemed
revealing without being invigorating, clustered about
the guardian figure of the tall old priest in black,
the somberly benignant old figure that towered above
the little wrecks on crutches and faced, as majestic
as Millet&#8217;s <i>Sower</i>, as austere and unmoved as Fate
itself, a dark sea overhung by a dark sky. Sorolla
was great in that picture, to my way of thinking.
He was great in the manner in which he attunes
nature to a human mood, in which he gives you the
sunlight muffled, in some way, like the sunlight during
a partial eclipse, and keys turbulence down to
quietude, like the soft pedal that falls on a noisy
street when a hearse goes by.</p>
<p>Josie felt it, and I felt it, that wordless thinning
down of radiance, that mysterious holding back of
warmth, until it seemed to strike a chill into the
bones. It was the darker wing of Destiny hovering
over man&#8217;s head, deepening at the same time that it
shadows the receding sky-line, so that even the
memory of it, a thousand miles away, could drain
the jocund blitheness out of the open prairie and
give an air of pathos and solitude to my own children
playing about my feet. Sorolla, I remembered,
had little ones of his own. He <i>knew</i>. Life had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
taught him, and in teaching, had enriched his art.
For the artist, after all, is the man who cuts up
the loaf of his own heart, and butters it with beauty,
and at tuppence a slice hands it to the hungry children
of the world.</p>
<p>So when Dinky-Dunk laughed at me, for going
into a trance over my own children, I merely smiled
condoningly back at him. I felt vaguely sorry for
him. He wasn&#8217;t getting out of them what I was
getting. He was being cheated, in some way, out
of the very harvest for which he had sowed and
waited. And if he had come to me, in that mood
of relapse, if he had come to me with the slightest
trace of humility, with the slightest touch of entreaty,
on his face, I&#8217;d have hugged his salt-and-peppery
old head to my bosom and begged to start
all over again with a clean slate....</p>
<p>Gershom and I get along much better than I had
expected. There&#8217;s nothing wrong with the boy except
his ineradicable temptation to impart to you
his gratuitous tidbits of information. I can&#8217;t object,
of course, to Gershom having a college education:
what I object to is his trying to give me one. I
don&#8217;t mind his wisdom, but I do hate to see him tear
the whole tree of knowledge up by the roots and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
floor one with it. He has just informed me that
there are estimated to be 30,000,000,000,000 red
blood corpuscles in this body of mine, and I made
him blink by solemnly challenging him to prove it.
Quite frequently and quite sternly, too, he essays to
correct my English. He reproved me for saying:
&#8220;Go to it, Gershom!&#8221; And he declared I was in
error in saying &#8220;The goose hangs high,&#8221; as that
was merely a vulgar corruption for &#8220;The goose
whangs high,&#8221; the &#8220;whanging&#8221; being the call of the
wild geese high in the air when the weather is settled
and fair. We live and learn!</p>
<p>But I can&#8217;t help liking this pedagogic old Gershom
who takes himself and me and all the rest of
the world so seriously. I like him because he shares
in my love for Dinkie and stands beside Peter himself
in the fondly foolish belief that Dinkie has somewhere
the hidden germ of greatness in him. Not
that my boy is one of those precocious little bounders
who are so precious in the eyes of their parents and
so odious to the eyes of the rest of the world. He
is a large-boned boy, almost a rugged-looking boy,
and it is only I, knowing him as I do, who can fathom
the sensibilities housed in that husky young body.
There is a misty broodiness in his eyes which leaves
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
them indescribably lovely to me as I watch him in
his moments of raptness. But that look doesn&#8217;t last
long, for Dinkie can be rough in play and at times
rough in speech, and deep under the crust of character
I imagine I see traces of his Scottish father in
him. I watch with an eagle eye for any outcroppings
of that Caledonian-granite strain in his make-up.
I inspect him as Chinkie used to inspect his
fruit-trees for San Jos&eacute; scale, for if there is any
promise of hardness or cruelty there I want it killed
in the bud.</p>
<p>But I don&#8217;t worry as I used to, on that score. He
may be rough-built, but moods cluster thick about
him, like butterflies on a shelf of broken rock. And
he is both pliable and responsive. I can shake him,
when in the humor, by the mere telling of a story. I
can control his color, I can excite him and exalt him,
and bring him to the verge of tears, if I care to,
by the mere tone of my voice as I read him one of
his favorite tales out of one of Peter&#8217;s books. But
I shrink, in a way, from toying with those feelings.
It seems brutal, cruel, merciless. For he is, after
all, a delicate instrument, to be treated with delicacy.
The soul of him must be kept packed away,
like a violin, in its case of reserve well-padded with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
discretion. Two things I see in him: tenseness and
beauty. And these are things which are lost, with
rough handling. He shrinks away from brutality.
Always, when he came to the picture of Samson pulling
down the pillars of the temple, in Whinstane
Sandy&#8217;s big old illustrated Bible, he used to cover
with one small hand a certain child on the temple
steps as though to protect to the last that innocent
one from the falling columns and cornices.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;m worried, at times, about Dinky-Dunk&#8217;s
attitude toward the boy. There are ways in which
he demands too much from the child. His father is
often unnecessarily rough in his play with him, seeming
to take a morose delight in goading him to the
breaking point and then lamenting his lack of grit,
edging him on to the point of exasperation and then
heaping scorn on him for his weakness. More than
once I&#8217;ve seen his father actually hurt him, although
the child was too proud to admit it. Dinky-Dunk,
I think, really wants his boy to be a bigger figure in
the world than his dad. Milord&#8217;s a middle-aged man
now and knows his limitations. He has realized just
how high the supremest high-water mark of his life
will stand. And being human, he must nurse his human
regrets over his failures in life. So now he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
wishes to see his thwarted powers come to fuller fruit
in his offspring. I&#8217;m afraid he&#8217;d even run the risk
of sacrificing the boy&#8217;s happiness for the sake of
knowing Dinkie&#8217;s wagon was to be hitched to the
star of success. For I know my husband well enough
to realize that he has always hankered after worldly
success, that his god, if he had any, has always been
the god of Power. I, too, want to see my son a
success. But I want him to be happy first. I want
to see him get some of the things I&#8217;ve been cheated
out of, that I&#8217;ve cheated myself out of. That&#8217;s the
only way now I can get even with life. I can&#8217;t live
my own days over again. But I can catch at the
trick of living them over again in my Dinkie.</p>

<h2><i>Thursday the Twenty-Ninth</i></h2>
</div>
<p>We have arrived at an armistice, Dinky-Dunk and
I. It was forced on us, for things couldn&#8217;t have
gone on in the old intolerable manner. Dinky-Dunk,
I fancy, began to realize that he hadn&#8217;t been quite
fair, and started making oblique but transparent
enough efforts at appeasement. When he sat down
close beside me, and I moved away, he said in a spirit
of exaggerated self-accusation: &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;ve got
a peach-stain on my reputation!&#8221; I retorted, at
that, that she had never impressed me as much of a
peach. Whereupon he merely laughed, as though it
were a joke out of a Midnight Revue. Then he
clipped a luridly illustrated advertisement of a nerve-medicine
out of his newspaper and pinned it on my
bedroom door, after I had ignored his tentative
knock thereon the night before. The picture showed
an anemic and woebegone couple haggling and shaking
their fists at each other, while a large caption
announced that &#8220;Thousands of Married Folks Lead
a Cat and Dog Life&mdash;Are Cross, Crabbed and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
Grumpy!&#8221;&mdash;all of which could be obviated if they
used Oxygated Iron.</p>
<p>What made it funny, of course, was the ridiculousness
of the drawing. Then Dinky-Dunk, right before
the blushing Gershom, accused me of being a
love-piker. I could sniff which way the wind was
blowing, but I sat tight. Then, to cap the climax,
my husband announced that he had something for
me which was surely going to melt my mean old
prairie heart. And late that afternoon he came
trundling up to Casa Grande with nothing more
nor less than an old prairie-schooner.</p>
<p>It startled me, when I first caught sight of it. But
its acquisition was not so miraculous as it might
have seemed. Dinky-Dunk, who is a born dickerer,
has been trading some of his ranch-stock for town-lots
on the outskirts of Buckhorn. On the back of
one of these lots stood a tumble-down wooden building,
and hidden away in this building was the prairie-schooner.
Something about it had caught his fancy,
so he had insisted that it be included in the deal.
And home he brought it, with Tithonus and Tumble-Weed
yoked to its antique tongue and his own Stetsoned
figure high on the driving seat. They had told
Dinky-Dunk it wasn&#8217;t a really-truly authentic prairie-schooner,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
since practically all of the trekking
north of the Fiftieth Parallel has been done by means
of the Red River cart. But Dinky-Dunk, after looking
more carefully over the heavy-timbered running-gear
and the cumbersome iron-work, and discovering
even the sturdy hooks under its belly from which the
pails and pots of earlier travelers must have hung,
concluded that it was one of the genuine old-timers,
one of the &#8220;Murphies&#8221; once driven by a &#8220;bull-whacker&#8221;
and drawn by &#8220;wheelers&#8221; and &#8220;pointers.&#8221;
Where it originally came from, Heaven only knows.
But it had been used, five years before, for a centenary
procession in the provincial capital and had
emerged into the open again last summer for a town-booming
<i>Rodeo</i> twenty miles down the steel from
Buckhorn. It looked like the dinosaur skeleton in
the Museum of Natural History, with every vestige
of its tarpaulin top gone. But Whinnie has already
sewed together a canvas covering for its weather-beaten
old roof-ribs, and has put clean wheat-straw
in its box-bottom, so that it makes a kingly place
for my two kiddies to play. I even spotted Dinkie,
enthroned high on the big driving-seat, with a
broken binder-whip in his hand, imagining he was
one of the original Forty-Niners pioneering along
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
the unknown frontiers of an unknown land. I could
see him duck at imaginary arrows and frenziedly
defend his family from imaginary Sioux with an
imaginary musket. And I stood beside it this morning,
dreaming of the adventures it must have lumbered
through, of the freight it must have carried
and the hopes it must have ferried as it once crawled
westward along the floor of the world, from water-hole
to lonely water-hole. I&#8217;ve been wondering
if certain perforations in its side-boards can be bullet-holes
and if certain dents and abrasions in its
timbers mean the hostile arrows of skulking Apaches
when women and children crouched low behind the
ramparts of this tiny wooden fortress. I can&#8217;t help
picturing what those women and children had to
endure, and how trivial, after all, are our puny hardships
compared with theirs.</p>
<p>And I don&#8217;t intend to dwell on those hardships.
I&#8217;m holding out the hand of compromise to my fellow-trekker.
Existence is only a prairie-schooner,
and we have to accommodate ourselves to it. And
I thank Heaven now that I can see things more clearly
and accept them more quietly. That&#8217;s a lesson Time
teaches us. And Father Time, after all, has to hand
us something to make up for so mercilessly permitting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
us to grow old. It leaves us more tolerant.
We&#8217;re not allowed to demand more life, but we can
at least ask for more light. So I intend to be cool-headedly
rational about it all. I&#8217;m going to keep
Reason on her throne. I&#8217;m going to be a bitter-ender,
in at least one thing: I&#8217;m going to stick to
my Dinky-Dunk to the last ditch. I&#8217;m going to
patch up the old top and forget the old scars. For
we&#8217;re in the same schooner, and we must make the
most of it. And if I have to eat my pot of honey
on the grave of all our older hopes, I&#8217;m at least
going to dig away at that pot until its bottom is
scraped clean. I&#8217;m going to remain the neck-or-nothing
woman I once prided myself on being. I&#8217;m
even going to overlook Dinky-Dunk&#8217;s casual cruelty
in announcing, when I half-jokingly inquired why
he preferred other women to his own Better-Half,
that no horse eats hay after being turned out to
fresh grass. I&#8217;m going on, I repeat, no matter what
happens. I&#8217;m going on to the desperate end, like
my own Dinkie with the chocolate-cake when I warned
him he&#8217;d burst if he dared to eat another piece and
he responded: &#8220;Then pass the cake, Mummy&mdash;and
everybody stand back!&#8221;</p>

<a name='TUESDAY_THE_FOURTH' id='TUESDAY_THE_FOURTH'></a>
<h2><i>Tuesday the Fourth</i></h2>
</div>
<p><i>Sursum corda</i> is the word&mdash;so here goes! I am
determined to be blithe and keep the salt of humor
sprinkled thick across the butter-crock of concession.
Dinky-Dunk watches me with a guarded and
wary eye and Pauline Augusta does not always approve
of me. Yesterday, when I got on Briquette
and made that fire-eater jump the two rain-barrels
put end to end Dinky-Dunk told me I was too old
to be taking a chance like that. So I promptly and
deliberately turned a somersault on the prairie-sod,
just to show him I wasn&#8217;t the old lady he was trying
to make me out. Gershom, who&#8217;d just got back
with the children and was unhitching Calamity Kate,
retreated with his eyebrows up, toward the stable.
And on the youthful face of Pauline Augusta I saw
nothing but pained incredulity touched with reproof,
for Poppsy is not a believer in the indecorous. She
has herself staidly intimated that she&#8217;d prefer the
rest of the family to address her as &#8220;Pauline Augusta&#8221;
instead of &#8220;Poppsy&#8221; which still so unwittingly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
creeps into our talk. So hereafter we must
be more careful. For Pauline Augusta can already
sew a fine seam and array her seven dolls with a
preciseness and neatness which is to be highly commended.</p>
<p>On Saturday, when we motored into Buckhorn for
supplies, I escorted Pauline Augusta to Hunk
Granby, the town barber, to have her hair cut Dutch.
Her lip quivered and she gave every indication of
an outbreak, for she was mortally afraid of that
strange man and his still stranger clipping-machine.
But I spotted a concert-guitar on a bench at the
back of Hunk&#8217;s emporium and as it was the noon-hour
and there was no audience, I rendered a jazz
<i>obbligato</i> to the snip of the scissors.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, Birdie, you&#8217;ll sure have me buck and wing
dancin&#8217; if you keep that up!&#8221; remarked the man of
the shears. I merely smiled and gave him <i>Texas
Tommy</i>, <i>cum gusto</i>, whereupon he acknowledged he
was having difficulty in making his feet behave. We
became quite a companionable little family, in fact,
as the bobbing process went on, and when Dinky-Dunk
called for us as he&#8217;d promised he was patently
scandalized to find his superannuated old soul-mate
sight-reading <i>When Katy Couldn&#8217;t Katy Wouldn&#8217;t</i>&mdash;it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
was a new one to me&mdash;in the second ragged
plush shaving-chair of a none too clean barber-shop
festooned with lithographs which would have made
old Anthony Comstock turn in his grave. But you
have to be feathered to the toes like a ptarmigan in
this northern country so that rough ways and rough
winds can&#8217;t strike a chill into you. The barber, in
fact, refused to take any money for Dutching my
small daughter&#8217;s hair, proclaiming that the music was
more than worth it. But my husband, with a dangerous
light in his eye, insisted on leaving four bits
on the edge of the shelf loaded down with bottled
beautifiers, and escorted us out to the muddy old
devil-wagon where Dinkie sat awaiting us.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dinky-Dunk,&#8221; I said with a perfectly straight
face as we climbed in, &#8220;what is it gives me such a
mysterious influence over men?&#8221;</p>
<p>Instead of answering me, he merely ground his
gears as though they had been his own teeth. So I
repeated my question.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you ask that school-teacher of
yours?&#8221; he demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;But what,&#8221; I inquired, &#8220;has Gershom got to do
with it?&#8221;</p>
<p>He turned and inspected me with such a pointed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
stare that we nearly ran into a Bain wagon full of
bagged grain.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t suppose I can&#8217;t see that that beanpole&#8217;s
fallen in love with you?&#8221; he rudely and raucously
challenged.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, I feel exactly like a mother to that poor
boy,&#8221; I innocently protested.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother nothing!&#8221; snorted my lord and master.
&#8220;Any fool could see he&#8217;s going mushy on you!&#8221;</p>
<p>I pretended to be less surprised than I really was,
but it gave me considerable to think over. My husband
was wrong, in a way, but no woman feels bad
at the thought that somebody is fond of her. It&#8217;s
nice to know there&#8217;s a heart or two at which one can
still warm one&#8217;s outstretched hands. The short-cut
to ruin, with a man, is the knowledge that women
are fond of him. But let a woman know that she is
not unloved and she walks the streets of Heaven, to
say nothing of nearly breaking her neck to make
herself worthy of those transporting affections.</p>
<p>But I soon had other things to think of, that
afternoon, for Dinkie and I had a little secret shopping
to do. And in the midst of it I caught the
familiar tawny look which occasionally comes into
my man-child&#8217;s eyes. It&#8217;s the look of dreaming, the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
look of brooding wildness where some unknown Celtic
great-great-grandfather of a great-great-grandfather
stirs in his moorland grave like a collie-dog
in his afternoon sleep. And it all arose out of nothing
more than a blind beggar sitting on an upturned
nail-keg at the edge of the sidewalk and rather miraculously
playing a mouth-organ and a guitar at
one and the same time. The guitar was a dog-eared
old instrument that had most decidedly seen better
days, stained and bruised and greasy-looking along
the shank. The mouth-organ was held in position
by two wires that went about the beggar&#8217;s neck, to
leave his hands free for strumming on the larger instrument.
The music he made was simple enough,
rudimentary old waltz-tunes and plaintive old airs
that I hadn&#8217;t heard for years. But I could see it
go straight to the head of my boy. His intent young
face took on the fierce emptiness of a Barres lion
overlooking some time-worn desert. He forgot me,
and he forgot the shopping that had kept him awake
about half the night, and he forgot Buckhorn and
the fact that he was a small boy on the streets of a
bald little prairie town. He was thousands of years
and thousands of miles away from me. He was a
king&#8217;s son in Babylon, commanding the court-musicians
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
to make sweet discourse for him. He was Saul
harkening to David. He was a dreamy-eyed Pict
listening to music wafted at dusk from a Roman
camp about which helmeted sentries paced. He was
a medieval prince, falsely imprisoned, leaning from
dark and lonely towers to catch the strains of some
wandering troubadour from his native Southlands.
He was a Magyar chieftain listening to the mountain-side
music of valleyed goat-herders with a touch
of madness to it. It engulfed him and entranced
him and awoke ancestral tom-toms in his blood. And
I waited beside him until the afternoon sunlight grew
thinner and paler and my legs grew tired, for I knew
that his hungry little soul was being fed. His eye
met mine, when it was all over, but he had nothing
to say. I could see, however, that he had been
stirred to the depths,&mdash;and by a tin mouth-organ
and a greasy-sided guitar!</p>
<p>To-night I found Dinkie poring over the pictures
in my Knight edition of Shakespeare. He seemed
especially impressed, as I stopped and looked over
his shoulder, by a steel engraving of G&eacute;r&ocirc;me&#8217;s <i>Death
of C&aelig;sar</i>, where the murdered emperor lies stretched
out on the floor of the Forum, now all but empty,
with the last of the Senators crowding out through
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
the door. Two of the senatorial chairs are overturned,
and C&aelig;sar&#8217;s throne lies face-down on the
dais steps. So Dinkie began asking questions about
a drama which he could not quite comprehend. But
they were as nothing to the questions he asked when
he turned to another of the G&eacute;r&ocirc;me pictures, this
one being the familiar old <i>Cleopatra and C&aelig;sar</i>. He
wanted to know why the lady hadn&#8217;t more clothes
on, and why the big black man was hiding down
behind her, and what C&aelig;sar was writing a letter for,
and why he was looking at the lady the way he did.
So, glancing about to make sure that Dinky-Dunk
was within ear-shot, I did my best to explain the
situation to little Dinkie.</p>
<p>&#8220;C&aelig;sar, my son, was a man who set out in the
world to be a great conqueror. But when he got
quite bald, as you may see by the picture, and had
reached middle age, he forgot about being a great
conqueror. He even forgot about being so comfortably
middle-aged and that it was not easy for
a man of his years to tumble gracefully into love,
for those romantic impulses, my son, are associated
more with irresponsible youth and are apt to be
called by rather an ugly name when they occur in
advanced years. But C&aelig;sar fell in love with the lady
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
you see in the picture, whose name was Cleopatra
and who was one of the greatest man-eaters that
ever came out of Egypt. She had a weakness for
big strong men, and although certain authorities
have claimed that she was a small and hairy person
with a very uncertain temper, she undoubtedly set a
very good table and made her gentlemen friends very
comfortable, for C&aelig;sar stayed feasting and forgetting
himself for nearly a year with her. It must
have been very pleasant, for C&aelig;sar loved power, and
intended to be one of the big men of his time. But
the lady also loved power, and was undoubtedly glad
to see that she could make C&aelig;sar forget about going
home, though it was too bad that he forgot, for
always, even after he had lived to write about all the
great things he had done in the world, people remembered
more about his rather absurd infatuation for
the lady than about all the battles he had won and
all the prizes he had captured. And the lady, of
course&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>But I was interrupted at this point. And it was
by Dinky-Dunk.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, hell!&#8221; he said as he flung down his paper and
strode out into the other room. And those exits, I
remembered, were getting to be a bit of a habit with
my harried old Diddums.</p>

<h2><i>Sunday the Fifth</i></h2>
</div>
<p>The Day of Rest seems to be the only day left to
me now for my writing. There are no idlers in the
neighborhood of Casa Grande. The days are becoming
incredibly long, but they still seem over-short
for all there is to do. The men are much too busy
on the land to give material thought to any
thing so womanish as a kitchen-garden. So I have
my own garden to see to. And sometimes I work
there until I&#8217;m almost ready to drop. On a couple
of nights, recently, when it came watering-time,
even these endless evenings had slipped into such
darkness that I could scarcely see the plants I was
so laboriously irrigating by hand. It wasn&#8217;t until
the water turned the soil black that the growing
green stood pallidly out against the mothering dark
earth.... But it is delightful work. I really love
it. And I love to see things growing. After the
bringing up of a family, the bringing up of a garden
surely comes next.</p>
<p>Yet too much work, I find, can make tempers a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
trifle short. I spoke rather sharply to Dinky-Dunk
yesterday regarding the folly of leaving firearms
about the house where children can reach them. And
he was equally snappy as he flung his ugly old Colt
in its ugly old holster up over the top corner of
our book-cabinet. So, to get even with him, when
Dinkie came in with some sort of wide-petaled field-flower
and asked if I didn&#8217;t want my fortune told, I
announced I rather fancied it was pretty well told
already.... Scotty, by the way, now follows
Dinkie to school and waits outside and comes loping
home with him again. And my two bairns have a
new and highly poetic occupation. It is that of
patiently garnering youthful potato-bugs and
squashing the accumulated harvest between two
bricks.</p>

<h2><i>Sunday the Twelth</i></h2>
</div>
<p>I have been examining Gershom with a more interested
eye. And when he changed color, under that
inspection, I apologized for making him blush. And
as that only added to his embarrassment, I artlessly
asked him what a blush really was. That, of course,
was throwing the rabbit straight back into the brier-patch,
as far as Gershom was concerned. For he
promptly and meticulously informed me that a blush
was a miniature epilepsy, a vasomotor impulse leading
to the dilation or constriction of the facial blood-vessels,
some psychologists even claiming the blush
to be a vestigial survival of the prehistoric flight-effort
of the heart, coming from the era of marriage
by capture, when to be openly admired meant imminent
danger.</p>
<p>&#8220;That isn&#8217;t a bit pretty,&#8221; I told Gershom. &#8220;It&#8217;s
as horrid as what my husband said about handshaking
originating in man&#8217;s desire to be dead sure
his gentleman friend didn&#8217;t have a knife up his sleeve,
for use before the greeting was over. It would have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
been so much nicer, Gershom, if you could have told
me that the first blush was born on the same day as
the first kiss.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Kissing,&#8221; that youth solemnly informed me, &#8220;was
quite unknown to primitive man. It evolved, in
fact, out of the entirely self-protective practice of
smelling, to determine the health of a prospective
mate, though this in turn evolved into the ceremonial
habit of the rubbing together of noses, which
is still the form of affectionate salutation largely
prevalent among the natives of the South Sea Islands.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What a perfectly horrible origin for such a heavenly
pastime,&#8221; I just as solemnly announced to Gershom,
who studied me with a stern and guarded eye,
and having partaken of his eleventh flap-jack, escaped
to the stable and the matutinal task of harnessing
Calamity Kate.</p>

<h2><i>Sunday the Second</i></h2>
</div>
<p>Summer is here, in earnest, and the last few days
have been hot and windless. School is over, for the
next eight weeks, and I shall have my kiddies close
beside me. Gershom, after a ten-day trip down to
Minneapolis for books and clothes, is going to come
back to Casa Grande and help Dinky-Dunk on the
land, as long as the holidays last. He thinks it will
build him up a bit. He is also solemnly anxious to
study music. He feels it would round out his accomplishments,
which, he acknowledged, have threatened
to become overwhelmingly scientific. So I&#8217;m to
give Gershom music lessons in exchange for his tutoring
Dinkie. They will be rather awful, I&#8217;m afraid,
for Gershom has about as much music in his honest
old soul as Calamity Kate. I may not teach him
much. But all the time, I know, I will be learning
a great deal from Gershom. He informed me, last
night, that he had carefully computed that the Bible
mentioned nineteen different precious stones, one
hundred and four trees or plants, six metals, thirty-five
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
animals, thirty-nine birds, six fishes, twenty insects,
and eleven reptiles.</p>
<p>As I&#8217;ve already said, summer is here. But it
doesn&#8217;t seem to mean as much to me as it used to,
for my interests have been taken away from the land
and more and more walled up about my family.
Dinky-Dunk&#8217;s grain, however, has come along satisfactorily,
and there is every promise of a good crop.
Yet this entirely fails to elate my husband. Every
small mischance is a sort of music-cue nowadays to
start him singing about the monotony of prairie-life.
Ranching, he protests, isn&#8217;t the easy game it used to
be, now that cattle can&#8217;t be fattened on the open
range and now that wheat itself is so much lower in
price. One has to work for one&#8217;s money, and watch
every dollar. And my Diddums keeps railing about
the government doing so little for the farmer and
driving the men off the land into the cities. He has
fallen into the habit of protesting he can see nothing
much in life as a back-township hay-tosser and that
all the big chances are now in the big centers. I
had been hoping that this was a new form of spring-fever
which would eventually work its way out of his
system. But I can see now that the matter is something
more mental than physical. He hasn&#8217;t lost
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
his strength, but he has lost his driving power. He
is healthy enough, Heaven knows. Indeed, he impresses
me as being a bit too much that way, for he
has quite lost his old-time lean and hungry look and
betrays a tendency to take on a ventral contour unmistakably
aldermanic. He may be heavy, but he
is hard-muscled and brown as an old meerschaum.
There is a canker, however, somewhere about the core
of his heart. And I can see him more clearly than
I used to. He is a strong man, but he is a strong
man without earnestness. And being such, I vaguely
apprehend in him some splendid failure. For the
wings that soar to success in this world are plumed
with faith and feathered with conviction.</p>
<p>It did not surprise me this morning when Dinky-Dunk
announced that he felt a trifle stale and suggested
that the family take a holiday on Tuesday
and trek out to Dead-Horse Lake for the day.
We&#8217;re to hitch Tumble-Weed and Tithonus to the
old prairie-schooner&mdash;for we&#8217;ll be taking side-trails
where no car could venture&mdash;and pike off for a
whole blessed day of care-free picnicking. So to-morrow
Struthers and I will be solemnly busy in
the kitchen concocting suitable dishes to be taken
along in the old grub-box, and when that is over
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
we&#8217;ll patch together something in the form of bathing-suits,
for there&#8217;ll be a chance for a dip in the
slough-water, and our kiddies have arrived at an
age imposing fit and proper apparel on their sadly
pagan but chastened parents.</p>

<h2><i>Wednesday the Fifth</i></h2>
</div>
<p>We have had our day at Dead-Horse Lake, but
it wasn&#8217;t the happy event I had anticipated. Worldly
happiness, I begin to feel, usually dies a-borning: it
makes me think of wistaria-bloom, for invariably one
end is withering away before the other end is even
in flower. At any rate, we were off early, the weather
was perfect, and the sky was an inverted tureen of
lazulite blue. Dinkie drove the team part of the
way, his dad smoked beside him up on the big driving-seat,
and I raised my voice in song until Pauline
Augusta fell asleep and had to be bedded down in
the wagon-straw and covered with a blanket.</p>
<p>Dead-Horse Lake is really a slough, dolorously
named because a near-by rancher once lost eight
horses therein, the foolish animals wandering out on
ice that was too thin to hold them up.</p>
<p>We were hungry by the time we had hobbled out
our teams and gathered wood and made a fire. And
after dinner Dinky-Dunk fell asleep and the children
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
and I tried to weave a willow basket, which wasn&#8217;t
a success. Poppsy, in fact, cut her finger with her
pater&#8217;s pocket-knife and because of this physical disability
declined to don her bathing-suit when we
made ready for the water.</p>
<p>The slough-water was enticingly warm, under the
hot July sun, and we ventured in at the west end
where a firmer lip of sand and alkali gave us footing.
And I enjoyed the swim, although Dinky-Dunk
made fun of my improvised bathing-suit. It seemed
like old times, to bask lazily in the sun and float
about on my back with my fingers linked under my
head. My lord and master even acknowledged that
my figure wasn&#8217;t so bad as he had expected, in a lady
of my years. I splashed him for that, and he dove
for my ankles, and nearly drowned me before I could
get away.</p>
<p>It was all light-hearted enough, until Dinky-Dunk
happened to notice that Dinkie wasn&#8217;t enjoying the
water as an able-bodied youngster ought. The child,
in fact, was afraid of it&mdash;which was only natural,
remembering what a land-bird he had been all his
life. His father, apparently, decided to carry him
out and give him a swimming-lesson.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span></p>
<p>I was on shore by this time, trying to sun out my
sodden mop of hair, which I had fondly imagined
I could keep dry. I heard Dinkie&#8217;s cry as his father
captured him, and I called out to Dinky-Dunk,
through my combed out tresses, to have a heart.</p>
<p>Dinky-Dunk called back that the Indian way, after
all, was the only way to teach a youngster. I didn&#8217;t
give much thought to the matter until the two of
them were out in deeper water and I heard Dinkie&#8217;s
scream of stark terror. It came home to me then
that the Indian method in such things was to toss
the child into deep water and leave him there to
struggle for his life.</p>
<p>Dinky-Dunk, I suppose, hadn&#8217;t intended to do
quite that. But the boy was naturally terrified at
being carried out beyond his depth, and when I
looked up I could see his bony little body struggling
to free itself. That timidity, I take it, angered the
boy&#8217;s father. And he intended to cure it. He was
doing his best, in fact, to fling the clutching and
clawing little body away from him when I heard those
repeated short screams of horror and promptly took
a hand in the matter. Something snapped in my
skull, and I saw red. I hated my husband for what
he was doing. I hated him for the mere thought
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
that he could do it. And I hated him for calling
out that this was what people got by mollycoddling
their children.</p>
<p>But that didn&#8217;t stop me. I made for Dinky-Dunk
like a hundred-weight of wildcats. I went through
the water like a hell-diver, and without quite knowing
what I was doing I got hold of him and tried to
garrote him. I don&#8217;t remember what I said, but I
have a hazy idea it was not the most ladylike of language.
He stared at me, as I tore Dinkie away from
him, stared at me with a hard and slightly incredulous
eye. For I&#8217;m afraid I was ready to fight with
my teeth and nails, if need be, and I suppose my expression
wasn&#8217;t altogether angelic. We were both
shaking, at any rate, when we got back to dry land.
Dinky-Dunk stood staring at us, for a silent moment
or two, with a look of black disgust on his
wet face. I&#8217;m even afraid it was something more
than disgust. Then he strode away and proceeded
to dress on the other side of the prairie-schooner,
without so much as a second look at us. And then
he went off for the horses, absenting himself a quite
unnecessary length of time. But I took advantage
of that to have a talk with Dinkie.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dinkie,&#8221; I said, &#8220;you and I are going to walk
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
out into that water, and this time you&#8217;re not going
to be afraid!&#8221;</p>
<p>I could see his eye searching mine, although he did
not speak.</p>
<p>I put one hand on the wet tangle of his hair.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you come?&#8221; I asked him.</p>
<p>He took a deep breath. Then he looked at the
slough-water. Then he looked back into my eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said, though I noticed his lips were not
so red as usual.</p>
<p>So side by side and hand in hand the two of us
walked out into Dead-Horse Lake. His eyes questioned
me, once, as the water came up about his armpits.
But he shut his teeth tight and made no effort
to draw back. I could see the involuntary spasms
of his chest as that terrifying flood closed in about
his little body, yet he was ready enough to show me
he wasn&#8217;t a coward. And when I saw that he had
met and faced his ordeal I turned him about and
led him quietly back to land. We were both prouder
and happier for what had just happened. We didn&#8217;t
even need to talk about it, for each knew that the
other understood. What still disturbs me, though,
is something not in my boy&#8217;s make-up, but in my own.
During the long and silent drive home I noticed a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
mark on my husband&#8217;s neck. And I was the termagant
who must have put it there, though I have no
memory of doing so. But from it I realize that I
haven&#8217;t the control over myself every civilized and
self-respecting woman should have. I begin to see
that I can&#8217;t altogether trust myself where my female-of-the-species
affections are involved. I&#8217;m no better,
I&#8217;m afraid, than the Bengal tigress which Dinky-Dunk
once intimated I was, the Bengal tigress who
will battle so unreasoningly for her offspring. It
may be natural in mothers, whether they wear fur or
feathers or lisle-thread stockings&mdash;but it worries me.
I was an engine running wild. And when you run
wild you are apt to run into catastrophe.</p>

</div>
<p>Dinky-Dunk is on his dignity. He has put a
fence around himself to keep me at a distance, the
same as he puts a fence around his haystacks to
keep off the cattle. We are coolly polite to each
other, but that is as far as it goes. There is something
radically wrong with this home, as a home, but
I seem helpless to put the matter right. It&#8217;s about
all I have left, in this life of mine, but I&#8217;m in some
way failing in my duty as a house-wife. &#8220;Home&#8221;
is a beautiful word, and home-life should be beautiful.
Any sacrifice and any concession a woman is
willing to make to keep that home, and to keep ugliness
out of it, ought to be well considered by the
judge of her final destinies. I&#8217;m ready to do my
part, but I don&#8217;t know where to begin. I&#8217;m depressed
by a teasing sense of frustration, not quite tangible
enough to fight, like cobwebs across your face. It&#8217;s
not easy to carry around the milk of human kindness
after they&#8217;ve pretty well kicked the bottom out of
your can!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span></p>
<p>Torrid and tiring are these almost endless summer
days. But it&#8217;s what the grain needs, and who am
I to look this gift-horse of heat in the face. Yet
there are two things, I must confess, in which the
prairie is sadly lacking. One is trees; and the other
is shade, the cool green sun-filtering shade of woodlands
where birds can sing and mossy little brooks
can babble. I&#8217;ve been longing all day for just an
hour up in an English cherry tree, with the pectoral
smell of the leaves against my face and the chance
of eating at least half my own weight of fresh fruit.
But even in the matter of its treelessness, I&#8217;m told,
the prairie is reforming. There are men living who
remember when there were no trees west of Brandon,
except in the coul&eacute;es and the river-bottoms. Now
that fire no longer runs wild, however, the trees are
creeping in, mile by mile and season by season. Already
the eastern line of natural bush country
reaches to about ten miles from Regina two hundred
miles west. Oxbow and Estevan, Dinky-Dunk once
told me, had no trees whatever when first settled,
though much of that country now has a comfortable
array of bluffs. And forestry, of course, is giving
nature a friendly push along, in the matter. In the
meantime, we have to accommodate ourselves to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
conditions that prevail, just as the birds of the air
must do. Here the haughty crow of the east is compelled
to nest in the low willows of the coul&eacute;e and
raise its young within hand-reach of mother earth.
Like our women, it can enjoy very little privacy of
family life. The only thing that saves us and the
crows, I suppose, is that the men-folks of this country
are too preoccupied with their own ends to go
around bird-nesting. They are too busy to break
up homes, either in willow-tops or women&#8217;s hearts.... I
ought to be satisfied. But I&#8217;ve been dogged,
this last day or two, by a longing to be scudding
in a single-sticker off Orienta Point again or to
motor-cruise once more along the Sound in a smother
of spray.</p>

<h2><i>Thursday the Thirteenth</i></h2>
</div>
<p>Dinky-Dunk has been called to Calgary on business.
It sounds simple enough, in these Unpretentious
Annals of an Unloved Worm, but I can&#8217;t help
feeling that it marks a trivially significant divide in
the trend of things. It depresses me more than I
can explain. My depression, I imagine, comes mostly
from the manner in which Duncan went. He was
matter-of-fact enough about it all, but I can&#8217;t get
rid of the impression that he went with a feeling very
much like relief. His manner, at any rate, was not
one to invite cross-examination, and he insisted, to
the end, on regarding his departure as an every-day
incident in the life of a preoccupied rancher. So I
caught my cue from him, and was as quiet about it
all as he could have wished. But under the crust
was the volcano....</p>
<p>The trouble with the tragedies of real life is that
they are never clear-cut. It takes art to weave a
selvage about them or fit them into a frame. But
in reality they&#8217;re as ragged and nebulous as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
wind-clouds. The days drag on into weeks, and the weeks
into months, and life on the surface seems to be running
on, the same as before. There&#8217;s the same superficial
play of all the superficial old forces, but in
the depths are dangers and uglinesses and sullen
bombs of emotional TNT we daren&#8217;t even touch!</p>
<p>Heigho! I nearly forgot my <i>sursum-corda</i> r&ocirc;le.
And didn&#8217;t old Doctor Johnson say that peevishness
was the vice of narrow minds? So here&#8217;s where
we tighten up the belt a bit. But we humans, who
come into the world alone, and go out of it alone,
are always hungering for companionship which we
can&#8217;t quite find. Our souls are islands, with a coral-reef
of reserve built up about them. Last night, when
I was patching some of Gershom&#8217;s undies for him,
I wickedly worked an arrow-pierced heart, in red
yarn, on one leg of his B.V.D.&#8217;s. This morning, I
noticed, his eye evaded mine and there was marked
constraint in his manner. I even begin to detect unmistakable
signs of nervousness in him when we
happen to be alone together. And during his last
music lesson there was a <i>vibrata</i> of emotion in his
voice which made me think of an April frog in a
slough-end.</p>
<p>Even my little Dinkie, day before yesterday, asked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
me if I&#8217;d mind not bathing him any more. He explained
that he thought he could manage very nicely
by himself now. It seemed trivial enough, and yet,
in a way, it was momentous. I am to be denied the
luxury of tubbing my own child. I, who always loved
even the smell of that earthy and soil-grubbing
young body, who could love it when it wasn&#8217;t any
too clean and could glory in its musky and animal-like
odors as well as the satin-shine of the light on
its well-soaped little ribs, must now stand aside before
the reservations of sex. It makes me feel that
I&#8217;ve reached still another divide on the continent of
motherhood.</p>
<p>This afternoon, when I wandered into the study,
I observed Dinkie stooping over a Chesterfield pillow
with his right hand upraised in a perplexingly dramatic
manner. He turned scarlet when he saw me
standing there watching him. But the question in
my eyes did not escape him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was pr&#8217;tendin&#8217; to be King Arthur when he
found out Guinevere was in love with Launcelot,&#8221;
he rather lamely explained as he walked away to the
window and stood staring out over the prairie. But
for the life of me I can&#8217;t understand what should
have turned his thoughts into that particular channel
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
of romance. Those are matters with which the
young and the innocent should have nothing to do.
They are matters, in fact, which it behooves even
the old and the wary to eschew.</p>

<h2><i>Sunday the Sixteenth</i></h2>
</div>
<p>It seems strange, in such golden summer weather,
that every man and woman and child on this sunbathed
footstool of God shouldn&#8217;t be sanely and
supremely happy.... My husband, I am glad to
say, is once more back in his home. And I have
been realizing, the last few days, that home is an
empty and foolish place without its man about. It&#8217;s
a ship without a captain, a clan without a chief.
Yet I found it both depressing and humbling to be
brought once more face to face with that particular
fact.</p>
<p>Dinky-Dunk, on the other hand, has come back
with both an odd sense of elation and an odd sense
of estrangement. He has taken on a vague something
which I find it impossible to define. He is
blither and at the same time he is more solemnly abstracted.
And he protests that his journey was a
success.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to ride two horses, from now on,&#8221; he
announced to me this morning. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got my chance
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
and I&#8217;m going to grab it. I&#8217;ve swapped my Buckhorn
lots for some inside Calgary stuff and I&#8217;m
lumping everything that&#8217;s left of my Coast deal for
a third-interest in those Barcona coal-fields. There&#8217;s
a quarter of a million waiting there for the people
with money enough to swing it. And I&#8217;m going to
edge in while it&#8217;s still open.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But is it possible to ride two horses?&#8221; I asked,
waywardly depressed by all this new-found optimism.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s <i>got</i> to be possible, until we find out which
horse is the better traveler,&#8221; announced Dinky-Dunk.
Then he added, without caring to meet my eye: &#8220;And
I can&#8217;t say I see much promise of action out of this
particular end of the team.&#8221;</p>
<p>I must have flamed red, at that speech, for I
thought at the moment he was referring to me. It
was only after I&#8217;d turned the thing over in my mind,
as I helped Struthers put together our new butter-worker,
that I saw he really referred to Casa
Grande. But my husband knows I will never part
with this ranch. He will never be so foolish as to
ask me to do that. Yet one thing is plain. His
heart is no longer here. He will stick to this prairie
farm of ours only for what he can get out of it.</p>
<p>Dinkie warmed the cockles of my heart by telling
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
me this afternoon when we were out salting the
horses that he never wanted to go away from Casa
Grande and his mummy. The child, I imagine, had
overheard some of this morning&#8217;s talk. He put his
arm around my knees and hugged me tight. And I
could see the tawny look come into his hazel eyes
speckled with brown. My Dinkie is a prairie child.
His soul is not a cramped little soul, but has depth
and wideness and undiscerned mysteries.</p>

<h2><i>Sunday the Thirtieth</i></h2>
</div>
<p>Two weeks have slipped by. Two weeks have
gone, and left no record of their going. But a
prairie home is a terribly busy one, at times, and
it&#8217;s idleness that leads to the ink-pot. I&#8217;m still trying
to make the best of a none too promising situation,
and I&#8217;ll thole through, as Whinstane Sandy
puts it. After breakfast this morning, in fact, when
Pauline Augusta was swept by one of those little
gales of lonesomeness to which children and women
are so mysteriously subjected, she climbed up into
my lap and I rocked her on my shoulder as I might
have rocked a baby. Dinky-Dunk wandered in and
inspected that performance with a slightly satiric
eye. So, resenting his expression, I promptly began
to sing:</p>
<table style='margin: auto' summary=''><tr><td>
<p style='margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;'>
&#8220;Bye-bye, Baby Bunting,<br />
Daddy&#8217;s gone a-hunting,<br />
To gather up a pile of tin<br />
To wrap the Baby Bunting in!&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>Dinky-Dunk, when the significance of this lilted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
flippancy of mine had sunk home, regarded me with
a narrowed and none too friendly eye.</p>
<p>&#8220;Feeling a bit larkier than usual this morning,
aren&#8217;t you?&#8221; he inquired with what was merely a
pretense at carelessness.</p>
<p>It was merely a pretense, I know, because we&#8217;d
been over the old ground the night before, and the
excursion hadn&#8217;t added greatly to the happiness of
either of us. Duncan, in fact, had rather horrified
me by actually asking if I thought there was a
chance of his borrowing eleven thousand dollars from
Peter Ketley.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t all trade on that man&#8217;s generosity!&#8221; I
cried, without giving much thought to the manner
in which I was expressing myself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, <i>that&#8217;s</i> the way you feel about it!&#8221; retorted
my husband. And I could see his face harden into
Scotch granite. I could also see the look of perplexity
in my small son&#8217;s eyes as he stood studying
his father.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is there anything abnormal in my feeling the
way I do?&#8221; I parried, resenting the beetling brow of
the Dour Man.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not if you regard him as your personal and
particular fairy god-father,&#8221; retorted my husband.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve no more reason for regarding him as that,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
I said as calmly as I could, &#8220;than I have for regarding
him as a professional money-lender.&#8221;</p>
<p>Duncan must have seen from my face that it would
be dangerous to go much further. So he merely
shrugged a flippant shoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;They tell me he&#8217;s got more money than he knows
what to do with,&#8221; he said with a heavy jocularity
which couldn&#8217;t quite rise.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then lightening his burdens is a form of charity
we can scarcely afford to indulge in,&#8221; I none too
graciously remarked. And I saw my husband&#8217;s face
harden again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve got to have ready money and I&#8217;ve got
to have it before the year&#8217;s out,&#8221; was his retort. He
told me, when the air had cleared a little, that he&#8217;d
have to open an office in Calgary as soon as harvesting
was over. There was already too much at stake
to take chances. Then he asked me if there were
any circumstances under which I&#8217;d be willing to sell
Casa Grande. And I told him, quite promptly and
quite definitely, that there was none.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then how about the old Harris Ranch?&#8221; he
finally inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;But why should we sell that?&#8221; I asked. Alabama
Ranch, I knew, was in my name, and I had always
regarded it as a sort of nest-egg for the children.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
It was something put by for a rainy day, something
to fall back on, if ill-luck ever overtook us again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because I can double and treble every dollar we
get out of it, inside of a year,&#8221; averred Dinky-Dunk.</p>
<p>&#8220;But how am I to know that?&#8221; I contended, hating
to seem hard and selfish and narrow in the teeth
of an ambitious man&#8217;s enterprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d have to take my word for it,&#8221; retorted
my husband.</p>
<p>&#8220;But we&#8217;ve more than ourselves to consider,&#8221; I
contended, knowing he&#8217;d merely scoff at that harping
on the old string of the children.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why I intend to get out of this rut!&#8221; he
cried with unexpected bitterness. And a few minutes
later he made the suggestion that he&#8217;d deed Casa
Grande entirely over to me if I&#8217;d consent to the sale
of Alabama Ranch and give him a chance to swing
the bigger plans he intended to swing.</p>
<p>The suggestion rather took my breath away. My
rustic soul, I suppose, is stupidly averse to change.
But I realize that when you travel in double-harness
you can&#8217;t forever pull back on your team-mate. So
I&#8217;ve asked Dinky-Dunk to give me a few days to
think the thing over.</p>

<h2><i>Wednesday the Second</i></h2>
</div>
<p>Casa Grande has had an invasion of visitors. It
was precious old Percy and his Olga who blew in
on us, after being swallowed up by the Big Silence
for almost four long years. They came without
warning, which is the free and easy way of the westerner,
appearing in a mud-splattered and dust-covered
Ford that had carried them blithely over two
hundred and thirty miles of prairie trails. And with
them they brought a quartet of rampageous young
buckaroos who promptly turned our sedate homestead
into a rodeo.</p>
<p>Percy himself is browner and stouter and more
rubicund than I might have expected, with just a
sprinkling of gray under his lopsided Stetson to
announce that Time hasn&#8217;t been standing still for
any of us. But one would never have taken him for
an ex-lunger. And there is a wholesomeness about
the man, for all his quietness, which draws one to
him. Olga herself still again impressed me as a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
Zorn etching come to life, as a Norse myth in petticoats,
with the same old largeness of limb and the
same old suggestion of sky-line vastnesses about her.
She still looks as though the Lord had made her
when the world was young and the women of Homer
did their spinning in the sunlight. Some earlier
touch of morning freshness is gone from her, it&#8217;s
true, for you can&#8217;t move about with four little toddlers
in your wake and still suggest the budding
vine. But that morning freshness has been supplanted
by a full and mellow noonday contentedness
which is not without its placid appeal. To her husband,
at any rate, she seems mysteriously perfect.
He can still sit and stare at her with a startlingly
uxorious eye. And she, in turn, bathes him in that
pale lunar stare of meditative approval which says
plainer than words just how much her &#8220;man&#8221; means
to her.</p>
<p>Percy and his family stayed overnight with us
and hit the trail again yesterday morning. An old
friend of Percy&#8217;s from Brasenose has taken a parish
some forty odd miles south of Buckhorn&mdash;a parish,
by the way, which ought to shake a little of the
Oxford dreaminess out of his system&mdash;and Olga and
her husband are &#8220;packing&#8221; their newly-arrived Toddler
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
Number Four down to the new curate to have
him christened.</p>
<p>We were all a bit shy and constrained, during our
first hour together but this soon wore away. It
wasn&#8217;t long before Olga&#8217;s offspring and mine were
fraternizing together, over-running the bathroom
tub and emptying our water-tank, and making a
concerted attack on one of Dinky-Dunk&#8217;s self-binders,
which would have been dismantled in short order,
if Percy hadn&#8217;t gone out to investigate the cause of
the sudden quiet.</p>
<p>&#8220;My boy loves everything with wheels,&#8221; explained
the proud Olga, in extenuation of her Junior&#8217;s oil-blackened
fingers.</p>
<p>That brought me up short, for I was on the point
of making the same statement about my Dinkie.
After thinking it over, in fact, I realized that <i>every</i>
normal boy loves everything with wheels. And it
began to dawn on me that there was nothing so extraordinary,
after all, in my son&#8217;s fondness for
machinery. I began to see that he was merely one
of a very wide-spread clan, when, an hour later,
the entire excited six united in playing Indian about
the haystacks, and kept it up until even the docile
Pauline Augusta was driven to revolt against so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
persistently being the Pale-face captive. She announced
that she was tired of being scalped. So,
for variety&#8217;s sake, the boys turned to riding and
roping and hog-tying one another like the true little
westerners they were, and many an imaginary brand
was planted on many a bleating set of ribs.</p>
<p>But now they are gone, and I&#8217;ve been thinking a
great deal about Olga. I fancy I have even been
envying her a little. She&#8217;s of that annealing softness
which can rivet and hold a family together. I&#8217;ve
even been trying to solace myself with the claim
that she&#8217;s a trifle ox-like in her make-up. But that
is not being just to Olga. She makes a perfect
wife. She is as tranquil-minded as summer moonlight
on a convent-roof. She is as soft-spoken as a
wind-harp swinging in an abbey door. She surrenders
to the will of her husband and neither frets
nor questions nor walks with discontent. I suppose
she has a will of her own, packed somewhere away
in that benignant big body of hers, but she never
obtrudes it. She placidly awaits her time, as the
bosom of the prairie awaits its harvesting. And
I&#8217;ve been wondering if that really isn&#8217;t the best type
of woman for married life, the autumnally contented
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
and pensively quiet woman who can remain unruffled
by man and his meanderings.</p>
<p>I wasn&#8217;t built according to that plan, and I suppose
I&#8217;ve had to pay for it. I&#8217;ve just about concluded,
in fact, that I would have been a hard nut
for any man to crack. I&#8217;ve never been conspicuous
for my efforts at self-obliteration. I&#8217;ve a temper
that&#8217;s as brittle as a squirrel bone. I&#8217;m too febrile
and flightly, too chameleon-mooded and critical.
The modern wife should be always a conservative.
She should hold back her husband&#8217;s impulses of nervous
expenditure, conserving his tranquil-mindedness
about the same as cotton-waste in a journal-box conserves
oil. Heaven knows I started with theories
enough&mdash;but I must be a good deal like old Schramm,
that teacher of Heine&#8217;s who was so busy inditing
a study of Universal Peace that his boys had all the
chance they could wish for pummeling one another.
But I&#8217;ve been thinking, Reuben. And I&#8217;m going to
see if I can&#8217;t save what&#8217;s left of the ship. I&#8217;m no
Renaissance cherub on a cloudlet, but I&#8217;m going to
knuckle down and see if I can&#8217;t jibe along a little
better with my old Dinky-Dunk. I&#8217;ve decided to
back off and give him his chance. If he&#8217;s set on
selling Alabama Ranch, on the terms he&#8217;s mentioned,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
I&#8217;m not going to object. He&#8217;s determined to make
money, to advance. And I don&#8217;t want to see him
accusing me of lying down in the shafts!... What
is more, I&#8217;m going out in the fields, when the push
is on, to help stook the wheat. That may wear me
down and make me a little more like Olga.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s difficult to be a woman, as the over-sensitive
Jean Christophe once remarked. Men are without
those confounding emotions which women seem to be
both cursed with and blessed with. When I announced
to Dinky-Dunk my willingness to part with
Alabama Ranch, he took it quite as a matter of
course. He betrayed no tendency to praise me for
my sacrifices, for my willingness to surrender to
strangers the land which had once been our home,
the acres on which we&#8217;d once been happy and heavy-hearted.
He merely remarked that under the circumstances
it seemed the most sensible thing to do.
There&#8217;s a one-horse lawyer in Buckhorn who has
been asking about the Harris Ranch and Dinky-Dunk
says he suspects this inquiring one has a client up
his sleeve.</p>
<p>What I had looked forward to as a talk which
might possibly beat down a few of the barriers of
reserve between us proved a bit of a disappointment.
My husband refused to accept me as a heroine. And
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
on his way out, as ill-luck would have it, he stopped
to observe Pauline Augusta struggling over a letter
to her &#8220;Uncle Peter.&#8221; It was a maiden effort along
that line and she was dictating her messages to
Dinkie, who, in turn, was laboriously and carefully
inscribing them on my writing-pad, with a nose and
a sympathetically working tongue not more than ten
inches away from the paper. Pauline Augusta, in
fact, had just proclaimed to her amanuensis that
&#8220;we had a geese for dinner to-day&#8221; when her father
stopped to size up the situation.</p>
<p>&#8220;To whom are you describing the home circle?&#8221;
questioned Pauline Augusta&#8217;s parent, with an intonation
that didn&#8217;t escape me.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a letter to Uncle Peter,&#8221; explained Dinkie&#8217;s
little sister. And I could see Duncan&#8217;s face harden.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s funny my whole family should fall for that
damned Quaker!&#8221; were the words he flung over his
shoulder at me as he walked out of the room.</p>

<h2><i>Tuesday the Fifth</i></h2>
</div>
<p>School has started again. And it&#8217;s a solemn
business, this matter of planting wisdom in little
prairie heads. Dinky-Dunk, who has been up to his
ears in haying and is now watching his grain with
a nervous eye, remarked that our offspring would
be once more mingling with Mennonites and Swedes
and Galicians and Ukrainians. I resented that
speech, though I said nothing in reply to it. But I
decided to investigate Gershom&#8217;s school.</p>
<p>So yesterday afternoon I drove over in the car.
I had a blow-out on the way, a blow-out which I had
to patch up with my own hands, so I arrived too late
to inspect Gershom conducting his classes. It was
almost four, in fact, before I got there, so I pulled
up beside the school-gate and sat waiting for the
children to come out. And as I sat there in the car-seat,
under a sky of unimaginable blue, with the
prairie wind whipping my face, I couldn&#8217;t help studying
that bald little temple of learning which stood
out so clear-cut in the sharp northern sunlight. It
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
was a plain little frame building set in one corner
of a rancher&#8217;s half-section, an acre of land marked
off by a wire fence where the two trails crossed, the
two long trails that melted away in the interminable
distance. It seemed a lonely little house of scholarship,
with its playground worn so bare that even
two months of idleness had given scant harborage
for the seeds that wind and bird must have brought
there. But as I stared at it it seemed to take on a
dignity all its own, the dignity of a fixed and far-off
purpose. It was the nest of a nation&#8217;s greatness.
It was the outpost of civilization. It was the advance-guard
of pioneering man, driving the wilderness
deeper and deeper into the North. It was life
preparing wistfully for the future.</p>
<p>From it I heard a sudden shrill chorus of voices
and the clatter of feet, and I knew that the day&#8217;s
work was over. I saw the children emerge, like bees
out of a beehive, and loneliness no longer reigned
over that bald yard in the betraying northern sunlight.
Yet they were not riotous, those children confronting
the wine-like air of the open. They were
more subdued than I had looked for, since I could
only too easily remember one of my earlier calls
for Dinkie at noon, when I found the entire class
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
turned out and riding a rancher&#8217;s pig, a heavy brood-sow
that had in some luckless moment wandered into
the school-yard and had been chased and raced until
it was too weary to resent a young barbarian mounting
its broad back and riding thereon, to the shouts
of the other boys and the shrill cries of the girls.
But now, from my car-seat, I could see Gershom
surrounded by a multi-colored group of little figures,
as he stopped to fix a strap-buckle on the school-bag
of one of his pupils. And as he stood there in the
slanting afternoon sunlight surrounded by his
charges he suddenly made me think of the tall old
priest in Sorolla&#8217;s <i>Triste Herencia</i> surrounded by his
waifs. I caught the echo of something benignant
and Lincoln-like from that raw-boned figure in the
big-lensed eye-glasses and the clothes that didn&#8217;t
quite fit him. And my respect for Gershom went
up like a Chinook-fanned thermometer. He took
those children of his seriously. He liked them. He
was trying to give them the best that was in him.
And that solemn purpose saved him, redeemed him,
ennobled his baldness just as it ennobled the baldness
of the four-square little frame building behind
him. I don&#8217;t know why it was, but for some reason
or other that picture of the northern prairie and the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
gaunt school-teacher surrounded by his pupils in the
thinning afternoon sunlight became memorable to me.
It photographed itself on my mind, not sharply, but
softened with a fringing prism of feeling, like a picture
taken with what camera-men call a &#8220;soft-focus.&#8221;
It touched my heart, in some way, and threatened
to bring a choke up into my foolish old throat.</p>
<p>It was Pauline Augusta who saw me first. She
came toward the car with her strapped school-books
and her lunch-box in her hand and a prim little
smile on her slightly freckled face. She impressed
me as a startingly shabby figure, in the old sealskin
coat which I had made over for her, worn clean
to the hide along the front, for even those early
autumn days found a chill in the air when the sun
began to get low. She had just climbed in beside
me when I caught sight of Dinkie. I saw him come
down the school-steps, stuffing something into the
pocket of his reefer-jacket as he came. He looked
startlingly tall, for a boy of his years. He seemed
deep in thought. There was, indeed, an air of remoteness
about him which for a moment rather
startled me, an air of belonging, not to me, but to
the world into which he was peering with such ardent
young eyes. Then he caught sight of me, and at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
the same moment his face both lightened and brightened.
He came toward the car quietly, none the less,
and with that slightly sidewise twist of the body
which overtakes him in his occasional moments of
embarrassment, for it was plain that he stood
averse to any undue display of emotion before his
playmates. He merely said, &#8220;Hello, Mummy&#8221; and
smiled awkwardly. But after he had climbed up into
the car and wormed down between Pauline Augusta
and me, and after I had tucked the old bear-robe
about them and called out to Gershom that I&#8217;d carry
my kiddies home, I could feel Dinkie&#8217;s arm push shyly
in behind my back and work its way as far around
my waist as it was able to reach. He didn&#8217;t speak.
But his solemn little face gazed up at me, with its
habitual hungry look, and I could see the hazel specks
in the brown iris of the upturned eye as the arm
tightened its hold on me. It made me ridiculously
happy. For I knew that my boy loved me. And I
love him. I love him so much that it brings a tapering
spear-head of pain into my heart, and at the very
moment I&#8217;m so happy I feel a tear just under the
surface.</p>

<h2><i>Sunday the Tenth</i></h2>
</div>
<p>I have been reading Peter&#8217;s latest letter to Dinkie,
reading it for the second time. It is not so frolicsome
as many of its fellows, but it impresses me as typical
of its sender.</p>
<p style='margin-left:1.0em; margin-right:1.0em; '>&#8220;I&#8217;ve to-day told fourteen cents&#8217; worth of postage-stamps
to carry out to you, dear Dinkie, a copy of
my own <i>Tales from Homer</i>, which may be muddy
with a few big words but which the next year or two
will surely see tramped down into easier going. You
may not like it now, but later on, I know, you will
like it better. For it tells of heroes and battles and
travels which only a boy can really understand. It
tells of the wanderings and adventures of strong and
simple-hearted men, men who are as scarce, nowadays,
as the shining helmets they used to wear. It
tells of women superb and simple and lovely as goddesses,
such as your own prairie might give birth to,
such as your own mother must always seem to us. It
tells of flashing temples and cities of marble overlooking
singing seas of sapphire, of stately ships
venturing over dark waters and landing on unknown
islands, of siege and sword-fights and caves and
giants and sea-goddesses and magic songs, and all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
that sunnier and simpler life which the world, as a
prosaic old grown-up, has left behind....</p>
<p style='margin-left:1.0em; margin-right:1.0em; '>&#8220;But I&#8217;m wrong in this, perhaps, for out in the
land where you live there is still largeness and the
gold-green ache of wonder beyond every sky-line.
And I can&#8217;t help envying you, Dinkie, for being a
part of that world which is so much more heroic than
mine. I live where a very shabby line of horse-cars
used to run; and you live where the buffaloes used
to run. I hear the rattle of the ash-cans in the morning;
and you hear the song of the wind playing on
the harp of summer. I pay five hundred dollars a
year to wander about a smoky club no bigger than
your corral; you wander about a Big Outdoors that
rambles off up to the Arctic Circle itself. And you
open a window at night and see the Aurora Borealis
in all its beauty; and I open mine and observe an
electric roof-sign announcing that Somebody&#8217;s Tonic
will take away my tired feeling. You put up your
blind and see God&#8217;s footstool bright with dew and
dizzy with distance; I put up mine and overlook a
wall of brick and mortar with one window wherein a
fat man shaves himself. And you can go out in the
morning and pick yellow crowfoot and range lilies;
and all we can pick about this place of ours are milk-bottles
and morning-papers packed full of murder
and theft and tax-notices!&#8221;</p>
<p>Much of that letter, I know, was over Dinkie&#8217;s
head. But it carried a message or two to Dinkie&#8217;s
mother which in some way threw her heart into high.
It was different from the letter that came the week
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
before, the one arriving two days ahead of Kingsley&#8217;s
<i>Water Babies</i> with six lines of Hagedorn inscribed on
its fly-leaf:</p>
<table style='margin: auto' summary=''><tr><td>
<p style='margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;'>
&#8220;And here you are to live, and help us live.<br />
Bend close and listen, bird with folded wings.<br />
Here is life&#8217;s secret: Keep the upward glance;<br />
Remember Aries is your relative,<br />
The Moon&#8217;s your uncle, and those twinkling things<br />
Your sisters and your cousins and your aunts!&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>This letter seemed like the Peter Ketley we knew
best, the sad-eyed Peter with the feather of courage
in his cap, the Peter who could caper and make you
forget that his heart had ever been heavy. For he
wrote:</p>
<p style='margin-left:1.0em; margin-right:1.0em; '>&#8220;This time, Dinkie-Boy, I&#8217;m going to tell you
about the sea. For the water-tank, as I remember it,
is the biggest sea you have at Casa Grande&mdash;unless
you count the mud when winter breaks up! And
your prairie, with its long waves of green, is, I suppose,
really a sea that has gone to sleep. But I mean
the truly honest-to-goodness sea which has tides and
baby-whales and steamers and cramps and sea-serpents
in it. You saw it once at Santa Monica, I
know, though you may have been too small to remember.
But yesterday, I motored to a place called
Atlantic City where they sell picture post-cards and
push you in a wheeled chair and let you sit on the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
sand and watch the Water Babies, whom the policemen
send to jail if they so much as walk along the
beach without their stockings on. These Water
Babies were not in a bottle&mdash;like the ones you&#8217;ll read
about in the book&mdash;but I think there was a bottle or
two in some of them, from the way they acted. But
one of them was in a pickle, for Father Neptune
caught her in his under-tow&mdash;which you must not
mix up with his under-toe, something with which only
the mermaids are familiar&mdash;and a life-guard had to
swim out and bring her in. And a few minutes after
that I saw a real beach-comber. I had read about
them in the South Sea Islands, but had never seen one
before. This one sat under a striped parasol, with a
mirror between her knees, and combed and combed
her hair until it was quite dry again. I was disappointed
in her knees, because I was hoping, at first,
she wouldn&#8217;t have any, but would be a mermaid who
had come up on the sand to sun herself and would
have a long and tapering tail covered with scales like
a tarpon&#8217;s. But all she had was beach-shoes tied
with silk ribbons, and I preferred watching the
water. For when I watch the ocean I always feel like
Mr. Hood and wish I was at least three small boys, so
that I could pull off my three pairs of shoes and
stockings and go paddling up to my six bare knees
and let the rollers slap against my three startled little
tummies and have thirty toes to step on the squids
and star-fish with. And when I went back to the
board-walk and watched all the gulls (I don&#8217;t think
I ever saw so many of &#8217;em in one place at once) I
couldn&#8217;t help thinking it was too bad the Pilgrim
Fathers didn&#8217;t wait for three centuries and land at a
bright and lively place like this, since it would have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
made them so much jollier and fizzier. They&#8217;d probably
have turned the <i>Mayflower</i> into a diving-float
and we&#8217;d never have had any Blue Laws to break and
that curious thing known as The New England Conscience
to keep us from being as happy as we feel we
ought to be.&#8221;</p>

<p>Harvest is on us, and Casa Grande hums like a
beehive. There are three extra &#8220;hands&#8221; to feed, and
Whinnie is going about with a moody eye because
Struthers is directing more attention than necessary
toward one of the smooth-spoken cutthroats now
nesting in our bunk-house. His name is Cuba Sebeck
and in times of peace he professes to be a horse-wrangler.
Struthers, intent on showing Whinnie
that he is not the only man in her world, is placidly
but patiently showering the lanky Cuba with a barrage
of her fluffiest pastries. She has also given her
hair an extra strong wash of sage-tea, which is
Struthers&#8217; pet and particular way of putting on war-paint.
Whinnie, I notice, shuts himself up after
supper with that copy of Burns&#8217; poems we gave him
last Christmas, morosely exiling himself from all the
laughing and gaming and pow-wowing which takes
place in the long cool twilights, just outside the bunk-house.
Cuba undertook to serenade the dour one by
donning certain portions of Struthers&#8217; apparel and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
playing my old banjo under his window. Whinnie
quietly retaliated by emptying his bath-water on the
musician&#8217;s head&mdash;and the language was indescribable.
I have been forced to speak to Dinky-Dunk, in fact,
about the men&#8217;s profanity before my children. It is
something I will not endure. My husband, on the
other hand, refuses to take the matter very seriously.
But I have been keeping a close eye over my kiddies&mdash;and
woe betide the horse-wrangler who uses unseemly
language within their hearing. So far they seem to
have gone through it unscathed, about the same as
a child can go through the indecorous moments of
<i>The Arabian Nights</i>, which stands profoundly wicked
to only Arabs and old gentlemen.</p>

<h2><i>Wednesday the Twenty-Eighth</i></h2>
</div>
<p>Summer is slipping away. The days are shortening
and there have been light frosts at night, but not
enough to hurt Dinky-Dunk&#8217;s late oats, which he has
been watching with a worried eye. There is a saber-blade
edge to the evening air now and we have been
having some glorious displays of Northern Lights.
I can&#8217;t help feeling that these Merry Dancers of the
Pole, as some one has called them, make up for what
the prairie may lack in diversity. Dusk by dusk they
drown our world in color, they smother our skies in
glory. They are terrifying, sometimes, to the tenderfoot,
giving him the feeling that his world is on fire.
Poor old Struthers, during an especially active display,
invariably gets out her Bible. Used to them as
I am, I find they can still touch me with awe. They
make me lonesome. They seem like the search-lights
of God, showing up my human littlenesses of soul.
They are Armadas of floating glory reminding me
there are seas I can never traverse. And the farther
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
north one goes, of course, the more magnificent the
displays.</p>
<p>Last night we watched the auroral bands gather
and grow in a cold green sky, straight to the north
of us, and then waver and deepen until they reached
the very zenith, where they hung, swaying curtains
of fire. No wonder the redskins call that wild
pageantry of color the ghost-dance of their gods.
Even as we watched them, opal and gold and rose and
orange and green, we could see them come wheeling
down on our little world like an army of angels with
incandescent swords. It made one imagine that the
very heavens were aflame, going up in quivering veils
of white and red and green. And when it was over I
listened to a long argument about the Aurora
Borealis, or the Aurora Polaris, as Gershom insisted
it should be called.</p>
<p>Dinky-Dunk contended that one could <i>hear</i> these
Northern Lights overhead, on a clear night. He
described the sound as sometimes a faint crackling,
like that of a comb drawn through your hair, and
sometimes as a soft rustling noise, like the rustling of
a silk petticoat heard through a closed door, coming
closer and closer as the display wavered farther and
farther toward the south.

<p>Gershom was disposed to dispute this, so our old
Klondiker, Whinstane Sandy, was called in to give
evidence. He did so promptly and positively, saying
he&#8217;d heard the Lights many a night in the Far North.
Gershom is still unconvinced, but intends to look up
his authorities on the matter. He attributes them
to sun-spots and asserts it&#8217;s a well-known fact they
often put the telephone and telegraph wires out of
commission. He has proposed that we sit up and
study them some night, through his telescope, which
he is disinterring from the bottom of his trunk....</p>
<p>My lord and master is going about with a less
clouded eye, for he has succeeded in selling the Harris
Ranch, and selling it for thirty-five hundred dollars
more than he had expected. It is to go, eventually,
to some tenderfoot out of the East, to some tenderfoot
who can have very little definite knowledge of
land-values in this jumping-off place on the edge of
the world. But may that tenderfoot, whoever he is,
be happy in his new home! Dinky-Dunk is now forever
figuring up what he will get for his grain. He&#8217;s
preoccupied with his plans for branching out in the
business world. His heart is no longer in his work
here. I sometimes feel that we&#8217;re all merely accidents
in his life. And that feeling leaves me with a heart
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
so heavy that I have to keep busy, or I&#8217;d fall to
luxuriating in that self-pity which is good for neither
man nor beast.</p>
<p>Yet Dinky-Dunk is not all hardness. He surprises
me, now and then, by disturbing little
gestures of boyishness. He announced to me the
other night that the only way to get any use
out of a worn-out husband was to revamp him,
with the accent on the vamp. I understood what
he meant, and I think I actually changed color
a trifle. But I know of nothing more desolating
than trying to make love to a man either against his
will or against your own will. It would be a terrible
thing to have him tell you there was no longer any
kick in your kisses. So I remain on my dignity. I
am companionable, and nothing more. When we
were saying good-by, the last time he went off to the
city, and he looked up at my perfunctory and quite
meaningless peck on his cheek, I felt myself blushing
before his quiet and half-quizzical stare. Then he
laughed a little as he turned away and pulled on his
gauntlets. &#8220;The sweeter the champagne, I suppose,
the colder it should be served!&#8221; he rather cryptically
remarked as he climbed into the waiting car. And
yesterday he let his soul emerge from its tent of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
reticence when he climbed up on the wagon-box to
stare out over his sea of all but ripened wheat.
&#8220;Come, money!&#8221; he said, with his arms stretched out
before him. Now, that was a trick which he had
caught from my little Dinkie. I don&#8217;t know how or
where the boy first picked up the habit, but when he
particularly wants something he stands solemnly out
in the open, with his two little arms outstretched, as
though he were supplicating Heaven itself, and says
&#8220;Come, jack-knife!&#8221; or &#8220;Come, jelly-roll!&#8221; or &#8220;Come,
rain!&#8221; according to his particular desires of the particular
moment. I think he really caught it from
an illustration in <i>The Arabian Nights</i>, from the picture
of Cassim grandiloquently proclaiming &#8220;Open
Sesame!&#8221; He is an imaginative little beggar.
&#8220;Mummy,&#8221; he said to me the other night, &#8220;see all the
moonlight that&#8217;s been spilled on the grass!&#8221; But
children are made that way. Even my sage little
Poppsy, when a marigold-leaf fell in the bowl of our
solitary gold-fish, cried out to me: &#8220;See, Mummy,
our fish has had a baby!&#8221; Sex is still an enigma to
her, as much an enigma as it was away last spring
when, not being quite sure whether her new kitten
was a little boy-cat or a little girl-cat, she sagaciously
christened it &#8220;Willie-Alice.&#8221; And a few weeks
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
later, when the unmistakable appearance of tail-feathers
finally persuaded even her optimistic young
heart that the two chicks which had been bequeathed
to her were dishearteningly masculine in their tendencies,
she officially re-christened the apostate &#8220;Elaine&#8221;
and &#8220;Rowena,&#8221; and thereafter solemnly accepted
them as &#8220;Archie&#8221; and &#8220;Albert.&#8221; And while speaking
of this mysteriously ramifying factor of sex, I am
compelled to acknowledge that I encountered a rather
disturbing little back-flare of Freudian hell-fire only
a couple of evenings ago. It took my thoughts galloping
back to the time in our post-nuptial era when
Dinky-Dunk went Berserker and chased me around
the haystacks with my hair flying. I&#8217;d taken Dinkie
upon my lap, and, without quite knowing it, sat
stroking his frowsy young head. My thoughts, in
fact, were a thousand miles away. Then, still without
giving much attention to what I was doing, I squeezed
that warm little body up close against my own. I
was astounded, the next moment, to see my small
offspring turn on me with all the lusty fierceness of
the cave man. He got his arms about me and buried
his face in my neck and kissed me as no gentleman,
big or little, should ever kiss a lady. His small body
was shaken with a subliminal and quite unexpected
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
gust of feeling, just as I&#8217;ve seen a June-time garden
shaken by an unexpected gust of wind. It passed
away, of course, about as quickly as it came&mdash;but
with it went a scattering of the white petals of childhood
unconcern.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t suppose my poor little Dinkie has yet
awakened to the fact that his body is a worn river-bed
down which must race the freshets of far-off racial
instincts. But the thing disturbed me more than I&#8217;d
be willing to admit. There are murky corridors in
the house of life. They stand there, and they must
be faced. There are rooms where the air must be
kept stirring, corners into which the clear sanity of
sunlight must be thrown. Dinkie, since he has
stepped into his first experience in the keeping of rabbits,
has been asking me a number of rather disconcerting
questions. His father, I notice, has the habit
of half-diffidently referring the boy to me, just as I
nursed the earlier habit of referring him to his father.
But some time soon Dinkie and I will have to have a
serious talk about this thing called Life, this Life
which is so much more uncompromisingly brutal than
the child-mind can conceive....</p>
<p>By the way, there&#8217;s a lot of nonsense talked about
motherhood softening women. It may soften them in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
some ways, but there are many others in which it
hardens them. It draws their power of love together
into a fixed point, just as the lens of a burning-glass
concentrates the vague warmth of the sun into one
small and fiercely illuminated area. It is a form of
selfishness, I suppose, but it is a selfishness nature
imposes upon us. And it is sanctified by the end it
serves. At every turn, now, I find that I am thinking
of my children. I seem to have my eyes set steadily
on something far, far ahead. I&#8217;m not quite certain
just what this something is. It&#8217;s a sort of secret
between me and the Master of Life. But the memory
of it makes my days more endurable. It allows me to
face the future without a quaver of regret. I am a
woman, and I am no longer young. But it gives me
courage to laugh in the teeth of Time.</p>
<p>And to laugh, to laugh whatever happens&mdash;that is
the great thing! It isn&#8217;t age I dread. But I&#8217;d hate
to lose that lightness with which those blessed ones
we call the young can move through the world, that
self-renewing freshness which converts every daybreak
into a dewy new world and mints every sunrise
into a brand new life ... I asked Gershom to-day
if he could possibly tell me how many Parker House
rolls a square mile of wheat running forty bushels to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
the acre would make. And he surprised me by inquiring
how many quarts of buttermilk it would take to
shingle a cow. Gershom is widening out a bit....</p>
<p>Dinkie, I notice, has just compiled a list of horses.
I read from his carefully ruled half-page:</p>
<p>&#8220;Draght horses; carriege horses; riding horses;
racing horses; ponyies; percheron from france; Belgain
from Beljium; shire clyesdale and saffold punch
from great Britain; french coach and German coach;
contucky saddle horses; through-breads; Shetland
ponies; mushstand ponies; pacers and pintoes.&#8221;
Thus recordeth my Toddler.</p>

<a name='SUNDAY_THE_NINTH' id='SUNDAY_THE_NINTH'></a>
<h2><i>Sunday the Ninth</i></h2>
</div>
<p>I have had Dinkie in bed for the last five days,
with a bruised foot. Duncan shortened the stirrups
and put the boy on Briquette, who had just proved a
handful for even an old horse-wrangler like Cuba
Sebeck. Briquette bucked and threw the boy. And
Dinkie, in the mix-up, got a hoof-pound on the ankle.
No bones were broken, luckily, but the foot was very
sore and swollen for a few days. No word about the
episode has passed between Duncan and me. But I&#8217;m
glad, all things considered, that I was not a witness
of the accident. The clouds are already quite heavy
enough over Casa Grande.</p>
<p>Dinkie and his mater, however, have been drawn
much closer together during the last few days. I&#8217;ve
talked to him, and read to him, and without either of
us being altogether conscious of it there has been an
opening of a closed door or two. Dinkie loves to be
read to. The new world of the imagination is just
opening up to him. And I envy the rapture of the
child in books, rapture not yet spoiled by the intellectual
conceit of the grown-up.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span></p>
<p>But I&#8217;m not the only reader about this ranch. I&#8217;m
afraid the copy of Burns which Santa Claus brought
to Whinstane Sandy last Christmas is not adding to
his matrimonial tendencies as love-plaints of that
nature should. At noon, as soon as dinner is over,
he sits on the back step, poring over his beloved
Tammas. And at night, now that the evenings are
chillier, he retreats to the bunk-house stove, where he
smokes and reads aloud. His own mother, he tells
me, used to say many of those pieces to him when
he was a wee laddie. He both outraged and angered
poor Struthers, last Sunday, by reading <i>Tam
O&#8217;Shanter</i> aloud to her. That autumnal vestal proclaimed
that it was anything but suitable literature
for an old philanderer who still saw fit to live alone.
It showed, she averred, a shocking lack of respect for
women-folk and should be taken over by the police.</p>
<p>Struthers even begins to suspect that this much-thumbed
volume of Burns lies at the root of Whinnie&#8217;s
accumulating misanthropy. She has asked me
if I thought a volume of Mrs. Hemans would be of
service in leading the deluded old misogynist back to
the light. The matter has become a more urgent one
since Cuba Sebeck suffered a severe bilious attack and
a consequent sea-change in his affections. But I&#8217;m
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
afraid our Whinnie is too old a bird to be trapped
by printer&#8217;s ink. I notice, in fact, that Struthers is
once more spending her evenings in knitting winter
socks. And I have a shadow of a suspicion that they
are for the obdurate one.</p>
<p>My Dinkie, by the way, has written his first poem,
or, rather, his first two poems. The first one he
slipped folded into my sewing-basket and I found it
when I was looking for new buttons for Pauline
Augusta&#8217;s red sweater. It reads:</p>
<table style='margin: auto' summary=''><tr><td>
<p style='margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;'>
No more we smel the sweet clover,<br />
Floting on the breeze all over.<br />
But now we hear the wild geese calling;<br />
And lissen, tis the grey owl yowling.</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>The second one, however, was a more ambitious
effort. He worked over it, propped up in bed, for an
hour or two. Then, having looked upon his work
and having seen that it was good, he blushingly
passed it over to me. So I went to the window and
read it.</p>
<table style='margin: auto' summary=''><tr><td>
<p style='margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;'>
<span style='margin-left: 0.78125em;'>O blue-bird, happy robbin&mdash;</span><br />
Who teached those birds to stick theirselves together?<br />
Who teached them how to put their tails on?<br />
Who teached them how to hold tight on the tree tops?<br />
Who gived them all the fetthers on their brest?<br />
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
Who gived them all the eggs with little birdies in them?<br />
Who teached them how to make the shells so blue?<br />
Who teached them how to com home in the dark?<br />
Twas God. Twas God. He teached him!</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>I read it over slowly, with a crazy fluttering of the
heart which I could never explain. They were so
trivial, those little halting lines, and yet so momentous
to me! It was life seeking expression, life groping
so mysteriously toward music. It was man
emerging out of the dusk of time. It was Rodin&#8217;s
<i>Penseur</i>, not in grim and stately bronze, but in a
soft-eyed and white-bodied child, groping his stumbling
way toward the border-land of consciousness,
staring out on a new world and finding it wonderful.
It was my Little Stumbler, my Precious Piece-of-Life,
walking with his arm first linked through the arm of
Mystery. It was my Dinkie looking over the rampart
of the home-nest and breaking lark-like into song.</p>
<p>I went back to the bed and sat down on the edge
of it, and took my man-child in my arms.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s wonderful, Dinkie,&#8221; I said, trying to hide the
tears I was so ashamed of. &#8220;It&#8217;s so wonderful, my
boy, that I&#8217;m going to keep it with me, always, as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
long as I live. And some day, when you are a great
man, and all the world is at your feet, I&#8217;m going to
bring it to you and show it to you. For I know now
that you are going to be a great man, and that your
old mother is going to live to be so proud of you it&#8217;ll
make her heart ache with joy!&#8221;</p>
<p>He hugged me close, in a little back-wash of rapture,
and then settled down on his pillows.</p>
<p>&#8220;I could do better ones than that,&#8221; he finally said,
with a glowing eye.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; I agreed. &#8220;They&#8217;ll be better and better.
And that&#8217;ll make your old Mummsy prouder and
prouder!&#8221;</p>
<p>He lay silent for several minutes. Then he looked
at the square of paper which I held folded in my
hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to send it to Uncle Peter,&#8221; he rather
startled me by saying.</p>

<h2><i>Saturday the Twenty-Ninth</i></h2>
</div>
<p>Once more I&#8217;m a grass widow. My Duncan is
awa&#8217;. He scooted for Calgary as soon as his threshing-work
was finished up. But that tumult is over
and once more I&#8217;ve a chance to sit down and commune
with my soul. Everything here is over-running
with wheat. Our bins are bursting. The lord of the
realm is secretly delighted, but he has said little about
it. He has a narrow course to steer. He is grateful
for the money that this wheat will bring in to him,
yet he can see it would never do to harp too loudly
on the productiveness of our land&mdash;on <i>my</i> land, I
ought to say, for Casa Grande has now been formally
deeded to me. I find no sense of triumph,
however, in that transfer. I am depressed, in fact,
at the very thought of it. It seems to carry a vague
air of the valedictory. But I refuse to be intimidated
by the future.</p>
<p>Gershom and I, indeed, have been indulging in the
study of astronomy. The air was crystal clear last
night, so that solemn youth suggested that we take
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
out the old telescope and study the stars. Which we
did. And which was much more wonderful than I
had imagined. But Gershom had no reflector, so
after getting a neck-ache trying to inspect the
heavens while on our feet we took the old buffalo-robe
and a couple of rugs out to a straw-pile that had been
hauled in to protect our winter perennials. There
we indecorously reposed on our backs and went stargazing
in comfort. And Gershom even forgot that
painful bashfulness of his when he fell to talking
about the planets. He slipped out of his shell and
spoke with genuine feeling.</p>
<p>He suggested that we begin with the Big Dipper,
which I could locate easily enough well up in the
northern sky. That, Gershom told me, was sometimes
called the Great Bear, though it was only a
part of the real <i>Ursa Major</i> of the astronomers.
Then he showed me Benetnasch at the end of the
Dipper&#8217;s handle, and Mizar at the bend in the handle,
then Alioth, and then Megrez, which joins the handle
to the bowl. Then he showed me Phaed and Merak,
which mark the bottom of the bowl, and then Dubhe
at the bowl&#8217;s outer rim.</p>
<p>I tried hard, but I was very stupid about getting
the names right. Then Gershom asked me to look
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
up at Mizar, and see if I could make out a small star
quite close to it. I did so, without much trouble, and
Gershom thereupon condescended to admit that I had
exceptionally good eyes. For that star, he explained,
was Alcor, and Alcor was Arabic for &#8220;the proof,&#8221;
and for centuries and centuries the ability to see
that star had been accepted as the proof of good
vision.</p>
<p>Then Gershom went on to the other constellations,
and talked of suns of the first and second magnitude,
and pointed out Sirius, in whose honor great temples
had once been built in Egypt, and Arcturus, the same
old Arcturus that a Hebrew poet by the name of
Job had sung about, and Vega and Capella and
Rigel, which he said sent out eight thousand times
more light than our sun, and is at least thirty-four
thousand times as big.</p>
<p>But it only made me dizzy and staggered my mind.
I couldn&#8217;t comprehend the distances he was talking
about. I just couldn&#8217;t make it, any more than a
bronco that had been used to jumping a six-barred
gate could vault over a windmill tower. And I had
to tell Gershom that it didn&#8217;t do a bit of good informing
me that Sirius was comparatively close to us, as it
stood only nine light-years away. I remembered how
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
he had explained that light travels one hundred and
eighty-six thousand miles a second, and that there
are thirty million seconds in a year, so that a light-year
is about five and a half million million of miles.
But when he started to tell me that some of the so-called
photographic stars are thirty-two thousand
light-years away from us my imagination just curled
up and died. It didn&#8217;t mean anything to me. It
couldn&#8217;t. I tried in vain to project my puny little
soul through all that space. At first it was rather
bewildering. Then it grew into something touched
with grandeur. Then it took on an aspect of awfulness.
And from that it grew into a sort of ghastliness,
until the machinery of the mind choked and
balked and stopped working altogether, like an overloaded
motor. I had to reach out in the cold air and
catch hold of Gershom&#8217;s arm. I felt a hunger to
cling to something warm and human.</p>
<p>&#8220;We call this world of ours a pretty big world,&#8221;
Gershom was saying. &#8220;But look at Betelgeuse up
there, which Michelson has been able to measure. He
has, at least, succeeded in measuring the angle at the
eye that Betelgeuse subtends, so that after estimating
its parallax as given by a heliometer, it&#8217;s merely a
matter of trigonometry to work out the size of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
star. And he estimated Betelgeuse to be two hundred
and sixty million miles in diameter. That means it
would take twenty-seven million of our suns to equal
it in bulk. So that this big world of ours, which takes
so many weeks to crawl about on the fastest ships
and the fastest trains, is really a mote of dust, something
smaller than the smallest pin-prick, compared
to that far-away sun up there on the shoulder of
Orion!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop!&#8221; I cried. &#8220;You&#8217;re positively giving me a
chill up my spine. You&#8217;re making me feel so lonesome,
Gershom, that you&#8217;re giving me goose-flesh.
You&#8217;re not leaving me anything to get hold of. You
haven&#8217;t even left me anything to stand on. I&#8217;m only
a little speck of Nothing on a nit of a world in a puny
little universe which is only a little freckle on the face
of some greater universe which is only a lost child
in a city of bigger constellations which in turn have
still lonelier suns to swing about, until I go on and
on, and wonder with a gasp what is beyond the end
of space. But I can&#8217;t go on thinking about it. I
simply can&#8217;t. It upsets me, the same as an earthquake
would, when you look about for something
solid and find that even your solid old earth is going
back on you!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span></p>
<p>&#8220;On the contrary,&#8221; said Gershom as he put down
his telescope, &#8220;I know nothing more conducive to
serenity than the study of astronomy. It has a tendency
to teach you, in the first place, just how insignificant
you are in the general scheme of things. The
naked eye, in clear air like this, can see over eight
thousand stars. The larger telescopes reveal a hundred
million stars, and the photographic dry-plate
has shown that there are several thousands of millions
which can be definitely recorded. So that you and
I are not altogether the whole works. And to remember
that, when we are feeling a bit important, is good
for our Ego!&#8221;</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t answer him, for I was busy just then
studying the Milky Way. And I couldn&#8217;t help feeling
that it must have been on a night like this that a
certain young shepherd watching his flocks on the
uplands of Canaan sat studying the infinite stairways
of star-dust that &#8220;sloped through darkness up to
God&#8221; and was moved to say: &#8220;When I consider the
heavens, the work of Thy fingers, the moon and the
stars which Thou hast ordained, what is man that
Thou art mindful of him, or the son of man that
Thou visitest him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Gershom, it&#8217;s horribly humiliating,&#8221; I said
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
as I squinted up at those serene heavens. &#8220;They last
forever. And we come and go out, and nobody knows
why!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pardon me,&#8221; corrected the literal-minded Gershom.
&#8220;They do not last forever. They come and
go out, just as we do. Only they take longer. Consider
the Dipper up there, for instance. A hundred
thousand years from now that Dipper will be perceptibly
altered, for we know the lateral movement
of Dubhe and Benetnasch will give the outer line of
the bowl a greater flare and make the crook of the
handle a trifle sharper. Even a thousand years would
show change enough for instruments to detect. And
a million years will probably show the group pretty
well broken up. But the one regrettable feature, of
course, is that we will not be here to see it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where will we be?&#8221; I asked Gershom.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; he finally admitted, after an unexpectedly
long silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;But will it all go on, forever and forever and forever?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To do so is not in the nature of things,&#8221; was Gershom&#8217;s
quiet-toned reply. &#8220;It is the destiny of our
own earth, of course, which most interests us. And
however we look at it, that destiny is a gloomy one.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
Its heat may fail. Stupart, in fact, has established
that its temperature is going down one and a half
degrees every thousand years. Or its volcanic elevating
forces may give out, so that the land will
subside and the water wash over it from pole to pole.
Or a comet may wipe up its atmosphere, the same as
one sponge-sweep wipes up moisture from a slate.
Or the sun itself may cool, so that the last of our race
will stand huddled together in a solarium somewhere
on the Equator. Or as our sun rushes toward Lyra,
it may bump into a derelict sun, just as a ship bumps
into a wreck. If that derelict were as big as our sun,
astronomers would see it at least fifteen years before
the collision. For five or six years it would even be
visible to the naked eye, so that the race, or what
remained of the race, would have plenty of time to
think things over and put its house in order. Then,
of course, we&#8217;d go up like a singed feather. And
there&#8217;d be no more breakfasts to worry over, and no
more wheat to thresh, and no more school fires to
start in the morning, and no more children to make
think you know more than you really do, and not
even any more hearts to ache. There would be just
Emptiness, just voiceless and never-ending Nothingness!&#8221;

<p>Gershom stopped speaking and sat staring up at
Orion. Then he turned and looked at me.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; he asked, for he must have
felt my shiver under the robe.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; I said in a thin and pallid voice. &#8220;Only
I think I&#8217;ll go back to the house. And I&#8217;m going to
make a pot of good hot cocoa!&#8221; ... And that&#8217;s
mostly what life is: making little pots of cocoa to
keep our bodies warm in the midst of a never-ending
chilliness!</p>

<h2><i>Tuesday the Eighth</i></h2>
</div>
<p>My husband is home again. He came back with the
first blizzard of the winter and had a hard time getting
through to Casa Grande. This gives him all the
excuses he could desire for railing at prairie life. I
told him, after patiently listening to him cussing
about everything in sight, that it was plain to see
that he belonged to the land of the beaver. He
promptly requested to know what I meant by that.</p>
<p>&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t the beaver regard it as necessary to dam
his home before he considers it fit to live in?&#8221; I
retorted. But Duncan, in that estranging new mood
of his, didn&#8217;t relax a line. He even announced, a
little later on, that a quick-silver wit might be all
right if it could be kept from running over. And it
was my turn to ask if he had any particular reference
to allusions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, for one thing,&#8221; he told me, &#8220;there&#8217;s this
tiresome habit of hitching nicknames on to everything
in sight.&#8221;</p>
<p>I asked him what names he objected to.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span></p>
<p>&#8220;To begin right at home,&#8221; he retorted, &#8220;I regard
&#8216;Dinkie&#8217; as an especially silly name for a big hulk of
a boy. I think it&#8217;s about time that youngster was
called by his proper name.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;d never thought about it, to tell the truth. His
real name, I remembered, was Elmer Duncan McKail.
That endearing diminutive of &#8220;Dinkie&#8221; had stuck to
him from his baby days, and in my fond and foolish
eyes, of course, had always seemed to fit him. But
even Gershom had spoken to me on the matter,
months before, asking me if I preferred the boy to
be known as &#8220;Dinkie&#8221; to his school mates. And I&#8217;d
told Gershom that I didn&#8217;t believe we could get rid of
the &#8220;Dinkie&#8221; if we wanted to. His father, I knew,
had once objected to &#8220;Duncan,&#8221; as he had no liking
to be dubbed &#8220;Old Duncan&#8221; while his offspring would
answer to &#8220;Young Duncan.&#8221; And &#8220;Duncan,&#8221; as a
name, had never greatly appealed to me. But it is
plain now that I have been remiss in the matter. So
hereafter we&#8217;ll have to make an effort to have our
little Dinkie known as Elmer. It&#8217;s like bringing a
new child into the family circle, a new child we&#8217;re not
quite acquainted with. But these things, I suppose,
have to be faced. So hereafter my laddie shall
officially be known as &#8220;Elmer,&#8221; Elmer Duncan
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
McKail. And I have started the ball rolling by duly
inscribing in his new books &#8220;Elmer D. McKail&#8221; and
requesting Gershom to address his pupil as &#8220;Elmer.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been wondering, in the meantime, if Duncan is
going to insist on a revision of all our ranch names,
the names so tangled up with love and good-natured
laughter and memories of the past. Take our horses
alone: Tumble-weed and timeless Tithonus, Buntie
and Briquette, Laughing-gas and Coco the Third,
Mudski and Tarzanette. I&#8217;d hate now to lose those
names. They are the register of our friendly love for
our animals.</p>
<p>It begins to creep through this thick head of mine
that my husband no longer nurses any real love for
either these animals or prairie life. And if that is
the case, he will never get anything out of prairie
living. It will be useless for him even to try. So I
may as well do what I can to reconcile myself to the
inevitable. I am not without my moments of revolt.
But in those moods when I feel a bit uppish I remember
about my recent venture into astronomy. What&#8217;s
the use of worrying, anyway? There was one ice
age, and there is going to be another ice age. I tell
myself that my troubles are pretty trivial, after all,
since I&#8217;m only one of many millions on this earth and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
since this earth is only one of many millions of other
earths which will swing about their suns billions and
billions of years after I and my children and my children&#8217;s
children are withered into dust.</p>
<p>It rather takes my breath away, at times, and I
shy away from it the same as Pauline Augusta shies
away from the sight of blood. It reminds me of
Chaddie&#8217;s New York lady with whom the Bishop
ventured to discuss ultimate destinies. &#8220;Yes, I suppose
I shall enter into eternal bliss,&#8221; responded this
fair lady, &#8220;but would you mind not discussing such
disagreeable subjects at tea-time?&#8221;</p>
<p>Speaking of disagreeable subjects, we seem to have
a new little trouble-maker here at Casa Grande. It&#8217;s
in the form of a brindle pup called Minty, which
Dinkie&mdash;I mean, of course, which Elmer, acquired in
exchange for a jack-knife and what was left of his
<i>Swiss Family Robinson</i>. But Minty has not been
well treated by the world, and was brought home with
a broken leg. So Whinnie and I made splints out of
an old cigar-box cover, and padded the fracture with
cotton wool and bound it up with tape. Minty, in
the moderated spirits of invalidism, was a meek and
well behaved pup during the first few days after his
arrival, sleeping quietly at the foot of Elmer&#8217;s bed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
and stumping around after his new master like a war
veteran awaiting his discharge. But now that
Minty&#8217;s leg is getting better and he finds himself in
a world that flows with warm milk and much petting,
he betrays a tendency to use any odd article of wearing
apparel as a teething-ring. He has completely
ruined one of my bedroom slippers and done Mexican-drawn-work
on the ends of the two living-room window-curtains.
But what is much more ominous,
Minty yesterday got hold of Dinky-Dunk&#8217;s Stetson
and made one side of its rim look as though it had
been put through a meat-chopper. So my lord and
master has been making inquiries about Minty and
Minty&#8217;s right of possession. And the order has gone
forth that hereafter no canines are to sleep in this
house. It impresses me as a trifle unreasonable, all
things considered, and Elmer, with a rather unsteady
underlip, has asked me if Minty must be taken away
from him. But I have no intention of countermanding
Duncan&#8217;s order. The crust over the volcano is
quite thin enough, as it is. And whatever happens,
I am resolved to be a meek and dutiful wife. But I&#8217;ve
had a talk with Whinnie and he&#8217;s going to fix up a
comfortable box behind the stove in the bunk-house,
and there the exiled Minty will soon learn to repose
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
in peace. It&#8217;s marvelous, though, how that little
three-legged animal loves my Dinkie, loves my Elmer,
I should say. He licks my laddie&#8217;s shoes and yelps
with joy at the smell of his pillow ... Poor little
abundant-hearted mite, overflowing with love! But
life, I suppose, will see to it that he is brought to
reason. We must learn not to be too happy on this
earth. And we must learn that love isn&#8217;t always
given all it asks for.</p>

<h2><i>Thursday the Seventeenth</i></h2>
</div>
<p>The crust over the volcano has shown itself to be
even thinner than I imagined. The lava-shell gave
way, under our very feet, and I&#8217;ve had a glimpse of
the molten fury that can flow about us without our
knowing it. And like so many of life&#8217;s tragic
moments, it began out of something that is almost
ridiculous in its triviality.</p>
<p>Night before last, when Struthers was rather late
in setting her bread, she heard Minty scratching and
whimpering at the back door, and without giving
much thought to what she was doing, let him into the
house. Minty, of course, went scampering up to
Dinkie&#8217;s bed, where he slept secretly and joyously
until morning. And all might have been well, even
at this, had not Minty&#8217;s return to his kingdom gone
to his head. To find some fitting way of expressing
his joy must have taxed that brindle pup&#8217;s ingenuity,
for, before any of us were up, he descended to the
living-room, where he delightedly and diligently proceeded
to remove the upholstery from the old Chesterfield.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
By the time I came on the scene, at any rate,
there was nothing but a grisly skeleton of the Chesterfield
left. Now, that particular piece of furniture
had known hard use, and there were places where the
mohair had been worn through, and I&#8217;d even discussed
the expediency of having the thing done over.
But I knew that Minty&#8217;s efforts to hasten this movement
would not meet with approval. So I discreetly
decided to have Whinnie and Struthers remove the
tell-tale skeleton to the bunk-house. Before that
transfer could be effected, however, the Dour Man
invaded the living-room and stood with a cold and
accusatory eye inspecting that monument of destructiveness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s Elmer?&#8221; he demanded, with a grim look
which started by heart pounding.</p>
<p>&#8220;Elmer&#8217;s dressing,&#8221; I said as quietly as I could.
&#8220;Do you want him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do,&#8221; announced my husband, whiter in the face
than I had seen him for many a day.</p>
<p>&#8220;What for?&#8221; I asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think you know what for,&#8221; he said, meeting my
eye.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure that I do,&#8221; I found the courage to
retort. &#8220;But I&#8217;d prefer being certain.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span></p>
<p>Duncan, instead of answering me, went to the foot
of the stairs and called his son. Then he strode out
of the room and out of the house. Struthers, in the
meantime, circumspectly took possession of Minty,
who was still indecorously shaking a bit of mohair
between his jocund young teeth. She and Minty vanished
from the scene. A moment later, however, Duncan
walked back into the room. He had a riding-quirt
in his hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s that boy?&#8221; he demanded.</p>
<p>I went out to the foot of the stairs, where I met
Elmer coming down, buttoning his waist as he came.
For just a moment his eye met mine. It was a questioning
eye, but not a cowardly one. I had intended
to speak to him, but my voice, for some reason, didn&#8217;t
respond to my will. So I merely took the boy&#8217;s hand
and led him into the living-room. There his father
stood confronting him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did that pup sleep on your bed last night?&#8221;
demanded the man with the quirt.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the child, after a moment of silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you hear me say that no dog was to sleep in
this house?&#8221; demanded the child&#8217;s father.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Elmer, with his own face as white as
his father&#8217;s.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Then I think that&#8217;s about enough,&#8221; asserted
Duncan, turning a challenging eye in my direction.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you going to do?&#8221; I asked. My voice
was shaking, in spite of myself.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to whale that youngster within an inch
of his life,&#8221; said the master of the house, with a
deadly sort of intentness.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want you to do that,&#8221; I quavered, wondering
why my words, even as I uttered them, should
seem so inadequate.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course you don&#8217;t,&#8221; mocked my husband. &#8220;But
this is the limit. And what you want isn&#8217;t going to
count!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want you to do that,&#8221; I repeated. Something
in my voice, I suppose, must have arrested him,
for he stood there, staring at me, with a little knot
coming and going on one side of his skull, just in
front of his upper ear-tip.</p>
<p>&#8220;And why not?&#8221; he asked, still with that hateful
rough ironic note in his voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because you don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re punishing
this child for,&#8221; I told him with all the quietness I
could command. &#8220;And because you&#8217;re in no fit condition
to do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t worry about my condition,&#8221; he cried
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
out&mdash;and I could see by the way he said it that he
was still blind with rage. &#8220;Come here, you!&#8221; he
called to Dinkie.</p>
<p>It was then that the fatal little bell clanged somewhere
at the back of my head, the bell that rings
down the curtain on all the slowly accumulated civilization
the centuries may have brought to us. I not
only faced my husband with a snort of scorn, but I
tightened my grip on the child&#8217;s hand. I tightened
my grip on his hand and backed slowly and deliberately
away until I came to the door of my sewing-room.
Then, still facing my husband, I opened that
door and said: &#8220;Go inside, Dinkie.&#8221; I could not see
the boy, but I knew that he had done as I told him.
So I promptly slammed the door shut and stood
there facing the gray-lipped man with the riding-quirt
in his hand. He took two slow steps toward
me. His chin was thrust out in a way that made me
think of a fighting-cock&#8217;s beak. He had not shaved
that morning, and his squared jaw looked stubbled
and blue and ugly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t pull that petticoat stuff this time,&#8221; he
said in a hard and throaty tone which I had never
heard from him before. &#8220;Get out of my way!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You will not beat that child!&#8221; And I myself
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
couldn&#8217;t have made a very pretty picture as I flung
that challenge up in his teeth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Get out of my way,&#8221; he repeated. He did not
shout it. He said it almost quietly. But I knew,
even before he reached out a shaking hand to thrust
me aside, that he was in deadly earnest, that nothing
I could say would hold him back or turn him aside.
And it was then that my eye fell on the big Colt in
its stained leather holster, hanging up high over one
corner of the book-cabinet, where it had been put
beyond the reach of the children.</p>
<p>I have no memory of giving any thought to the
matter. My reaction must have been both immediate
and automatic. I don&#8217;t think I even intended to bunt
my husband in the short-ribs the way I did, for the
impact of my body half twisted him about and sent
him staggering back several steps. All I know is that
holster and belt came tumbling down as I sprang and
caught at the Colt handle. And I was back at the
door before I had even shaken the revolver free. I
was back just in time to hear my husband say, rather
foolishly, for the third time: &#8220;Get out of my way!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You stay back there!&#8221; I called, quite as foolishly,
for by this time I had the Colt balanced in my hand
and was pointing it directly at his body.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span></p>
<p>He stopped short, with a vacuous look in his eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>You fool!</i>&#8221; he said, in a sort of strangled whisper.
But it was my face, and not the weapon, that he was
staring at all the while.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stay back!&#8221; I said again, with my eyes fixed on
his.</p>
<p>He hesitated, for a moment, and made a sound that
was like the short bark of a laugh. It was too hard
and horrible, though, ever to be taken for laughter.
And I knew that he was not going to do what I had
said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stay back!&#8221; I warned him still again. But he
stepped forward, with a grim sort of deliberation,
with his challenging gaze locked on mine. I could
hear a thousand warning voices, somewhere at the
back of my brain, and at the same time I could hear
a thousand singing devils in my blood trying to
drown out those voices. I could see my husband&#8217;s
narrowed eyes slowly widen, slowly open like the gills
of a dying fish, for the hate that he must have seen
on my face obviously arrested him. It arrested him,
but it arrested him only for a moment. He dropped
his eyes to the Colt in my hand. Then he moved
deliberately forward until his body was almost
against the barrel-end. I must have known what it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
meant, just as he must have known what it meant.
It was his final challenge. And I must have met that
challenge. For, without quite knowing it, I shut my
eyes and pulled the trigger.</p>
<p>There had been something awful, I know, in that
momentary silence. And there was something awful
in the sound that came after it, though it was not the
sound my subconscious mind was waiting for. It
was distinct enough and significant enough, heaven
knows. But instead of the explosion of a shell it was
the sharp snap of steel against steel.</p>
<p>The revolver was empty. It was empty-had been
empty for weeks. But the significant fact remained
that I had deliberately pulled the trigger. I had
stood ready, in my moment of madness, to kill the
man that I lived with....</p>
<p>Had a ball of lead gone through that man&#8217;s body,
I don&#8217;t think he could have staggered back with a
more startled expression on his face. He looked
more than bewildered; he looked vaguely humiliated,
oddly and wordlessly affronted, as he stood leaning
against the table-edge, breathing hard, his skin a
mottled blue-white to the very lips. He made an
effort to speak, but no sound came from him. For a
moment the dreadful thought raced through me that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
I had indeed shot him, that in some mysterious way
he was mortally hurt, without this particular bullet
announcing itself as bullets usually do. I looked at
the revolver, stupidly. It seemed to have grown
heavy, as heavy as a cook-stove in my hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d do that?&#8221; whispered my husband, very
slowly, with a stricken light in his eyes which I
couldn&#8217;t quite understand. I intended to put the
Colt on the table. But something must have been
wrong with my vision, for the loathsome thing fell
loathsomely to the floor. I felt sick and shaken and
a horrible misty feeling of homelessness settled down
about me, of a sudden, for I remembered how closely
I had skirted the black gulf of murder.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Dinky-Dunk!&#8221; I blubbered, weakly, as I
groped toward him. He must have thought that I
was going to fall, for he put out his arm and held me
up. He held me up, but there wasn&#8217;t an atom of
warmth in his embrace. He held me up about the
same as he&#8217;d hold up an open wheat-sack that threatened
to tumble over on his granary floor. I don&#8217;t
know what reaction it was that took my strength
away from me, but I clung to his shoulders and
sobbed there. I felt as alone in the gray wastes of
time as one of Gershom&#8217;s lost stars. And I knew that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
my Dinky-Dunk would never bend down now and
whisper into my ear any word of comfort, any word
of forgiveness. For, however things may have been
at the first, I was the one who was now so hopelessly
in the wrong, <i>I</i> was the big offender. And that
knowledge only added to my misery as I stood there
clinging to my husband&#8217;s shoulders and blubbering
&#8220;Oh, Dinky-Dunk!&#8221;</p>
<p>It must have grown distasteful to him, my foolish
hanging on to him as though he were a hitching-post,
for he finally said in a remote voice: &#8220;I guess we&#8217;ve
had about enough of this.&#8221; He led me rather ceremoniously
to a chair, and slowly let me down in it.
Then he crossed over to the old leather holster and
picked it up, and stooped for the revolver, and
pushed it down in the holster and buckled the cover-flap
and tossed the whole thing up to the top of the
book-cabinet again. Then, without speaking to me,
he walked slowly out of the room.</p>
<p>I was tempted to call him back, but I knew, on
second thought, that it would be no use. I merely
sat there, staring ahead of me. Then I shut my eyes
and tried to think. I don&#8217;t know why, but I was
thinking about the bigness of Betelgeuse, which was
twenty-seven million times as big as our sun and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
which was going on through its millions of miles of
space without knowing anything about Chaddie
McKail and what had happened to her that morning.
I was wondering if there were worlds between me and
Betelgeuse with women on them, with women as alone
as I was, when I felt a pair of small arms tighten
about my knees and an adoring small voice whispered
&#8220;Mummsy!&#8221; And I forgot about Betelgeuse. For
it was my Dinkie there, with his little rough hand
reaching hungrily for mine....</p>
<p>Minty has been removed from Casa Grande. I
took him over to the Teetzel ranch in the car, and
young Dode Teetzel is to get a dollar a week for
looking after him and feeding him. Only Elmer and
I know of his whereabouts. And once a week the
boy can canter over on Buntie and keep in touch with
his pup.</p>
<p>We have a tacit understanding that the occurrences
of yesterday morning are a closed chapter, are
not to be referred to by word or deed. Duncan himself
found it necessary to team in to Buckhorn and
left word with Struthers that he would stay in town
over night. The call for the Buckhorn trip was, of
course, a polite fabrication, an expedient <i>pax in bello</i>
to permit the dust of battle to settle a little about
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
this troubled house of McKail. All day to-day I
have felt rather languid. I suppose it&#8217;s the lethargy which
naturally follows after all violence. Any
respectable woman, I used to think, could keep a
dead-line in her soul, beyond which the impulses of
evil dare not venture. But I must have been wrong.... All
week I&#8217;ve been looking for a letter from
Peter Ketley. But for once in his life he seems to
have forgotten us.</p>

<h2><i>Sunday the Twentieth</i></h2>
</div>
<p>I&#8217;ve been wondering to-day just what I&#8217;d do if I
had to earn my own living. I could run a ranch, I
suppose, if I still had one, but two or three years of
such work would see me a hatchet-faced old termagant
with fallen arches and a prairie-squint. Or I
could raise chickens and peddle dated eggs in a
flivver-and fresco hen-coops with whitewash until
the trap-nest of time swallowed me up in oblivion.
Or I could take a rural school somewhere and teach
the three R&#8217;s to little Slovenes and Frisians and
French-Canadians even more urgently in need of
soap and water. Or perhaps I could be housekeeper
for one of our new beef-kings in his new Queen-Anne
Norman-Georgian Venetian palace of Alberta sandstone
with tesselated towers and bungalow sleeping-porches.
Or I might even peddle magazines, or start
a little bakery in one of the little board-fronted shops
of Buckhorn, or take in plain sewing and dispose of
home-made preserves to the &eacute;lite of the community.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span></p>
<p>But each and all of them would be mere gestures
of defeat. I&#8217;m of no value to the world. There was a
time when I regarded myself as quite a Somebody,
and prided myself on having an idea or
two. Didn&#8217;t Percy even once denominate me as
&#8220;a window-dresser&#8221;? There was a time when I
didn&#8217;t have to wait to see if the pearl-handled knife
was the one intended for the fish-course, and I could
walk across a waxed floor without breaking my neck
and do a bit of shopping in the Rue de la Paix without
being taken for a tourist. But that was a long,
long time ago. And life during the last few years has
both humbled me and taught me my limitations. I&#8217;m
a house-wife, now, and nothing more&mdash;and not even
a successful house-wife. I&#8217;ve let everything fall away
except the thought of my home and my family. And
now I find that the basket into which I so carefully
packed all my eggs hasn&#8217;t even a bottom to it.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;ve no intention of repining. Heaven knows
I&#8217;ve never wanted to sit on the Mourner&#8217;s Bench.
I&#8217;ve never tried to pull a sour mug, as Dinky-Dunk
once inelegantly expressed it. I love life and the joy
of life, and I want all of it I can get. I believe in
laughter, and I&#8217;ve a weakness for men and women who
can sing as they work. But I&#8217;ve blundered into a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
black frost, and even though there was something to
sing about, there&#8217;s scarcely a blue-bird left to do the
singing. But sometime, somewhere, there&#8217;ll be an end
to that silence. The blight will pass, and I&#8217;ll break
out again. I know it. I don&#8217;t intend to be held
down. I <i>can&#8217;t</i> be held down. I haven&#8217;t the remotest
idea of how it&#8217;s going to happen, but I&#8217;m going to
love life again, and be happy, and carol out like a
meadow-lark on a blue and breezy April morning.
It may not come to-morrow, and it may not come the
next day. But it&#8217;s going to come. And knowing it&#8217;s
going to come, I can afford to sit tight, and abide
my time....</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve just had a letter from Uncle Chandler, enclosing
snap-shots of the place he&#8217;s bought in New
Jersey. It looks very palatial and settled and Old-Worldish,
shaded and shadowed with trees and softened
with herbage, dignified by the hand of time. It
reminds me how many and many a long year will have
to go by before our bald young prairie can be tamed
and petted into a homeyness like that. Uncle
Chandler has rather startled me by suggesting that
we send Elmer through to him, to go to school in the
East. He says the boy can attend Montclair Academy,
that he can be taken there and called for every
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
day by faithful old Fisher, in the cabriolet, and that
on Sunday he can be toted regularly to St. Luke&#8217;s
Episcopal Church, and occasionally go into New
York for some of the better concerts, and even have
a governess of his own, if he&#8217;d care for it. And in
case I should be worrying about his welfare Uncle
Chandler would send me a weekly night-letter &#8220;describing
the condition and the activities of the child,&#8221;
as the letter expresses it. It sounds very appealing,
but every time I try to think it over my heart goes
down like a dab-chick. My Dinkie is such a little
fellow. And he&#8217;s my first-born, my man-child, and
he means so much in my life. Yet he and his father
are not getting along very well together. It would
be better, in many respects, if the boy could get away
for a while, until the raw edges healed over again.
It would be better for both of them. But there&#8217;s one
thing that would happen: he would grow away from
his mother. He&#8217;d come back to me a stranger. He&#8217;d
come back a little ashamed of his shabby prairie
mater, with her ten-years-old style of hair-dressing
and her moss-grown ideas of things and her bald-looking
prairie home with no repose and no dignifying
background and neither a private gym nor a
butler to wheel in the cinnamon-toast. He&#8217;d be having
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
all those things, under Uncle Chandler&#8217;s roof:
he&#8217;d get used to them and he&#8217;d expect them.</p>
<p>But there&#8217;s one thing he wouldn&#8217;t and couldn&#8217;t
have. He wouldn&#8217;t have his mother. And no one can
take a mother&#8217;s place, with a boy like that. No one
could understand him, and make allowances for him,
and explain things to him, as his own mother could.
I&#8217;ve been thinking about that, all afternoon as I
ironed his waists and his blue flannellet pajamas
with frogs on like his dad&#8217;s. And I&#8217;ve been thinking
of it all evening as I patched his brown corduroy
knickers and darned his little stockings and balled
them up in a neat little row. I tried to picture
myself as packing them away in a trunk, and putting
in beside them all the clothes he would need, and the
books that he could never get along without, and the
childish little treasures he&#8217;d have to carry away to
his new home. But it was too much for me. There
was one thing, I began to see, which could never,
never happen. I could never willingly be parted from
my Dinkie. I could think of nothing to pay me up
for losing him. And he needed me as I needed him.
For good or bad, we&#8217;d have to stick together. Mother
and son, together in some way we&#8217;d have to sink or
swim!</p>

<h2><i>Wednesday the Thirtieth</i></h2>
</div>
<p>The tension has been relieved by Dinky-Dunk
going off to Calgary. Along with him he has taken
a rather formidable amount of his personal belongings.
But he explains this by stating that business
will keep him in the city for at least six or seven
weeks. He has been talking a good deal about the
Barcona coal-mine of late, and the last night he was
with us he talked to Gershom for an hour and more
about the advantages of those newer mines over the
Drumheller. The newer field has a solid slate roof
which makes drifting safe and easy, a finer type of
coal, and a chance for big money once the railway
runs in its spur and the officials wake up to the
importance of giving them the cars they need. The
whole country, Dinky-Dunk claims, is underlaid with
coal, and our province alone is estimated to contain
almost seventeen per cent. of the world&#8217;s known supply.
And my lord and master expressed the intention
of being in on the clean-up.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know how much of this was intended for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
my ears. But it served to disquiet me, for reasons
I couldn&#8217;t quite discern. And the same vague depression
crept over me when Dinky-Dunk took his
departure. I kept up my air of blitheness, it is true,
to the last moment, and was as casual as you please
in helping Duncan to pack and reminding him to put
his shaving-things in his bag and making sure the
last button was on his pajamas. I kissed him
good-by, as a dutiful wife ought, and held Pauline
Augusta up in the doorway so that she might attempt
a last-minute hand-waving at her daddy.</p>
<p>But I slumped, once it was all over. I felt mysteriously
alone in an indifferent big world with the
rime of winter creeping along its edges. Even Gershom,
after the children had had their lesson, became
conscious of my preoccupation and went so far as to
ask if I wasn&#8217;t feeling well.</p>
<p>I smilingly assured him that there was nothing
much wrong with me.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Lerne zu leiden ohne zu klagen!</i>&#8221; as the dying
Frederick said to a singularly foolish son.</p>
<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;re upset?&#8221; persisted Gershom, with his
valorous brand of timidity that so often reminds me
of a robin defending her eggs.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it&#8217;s not that,&#8221; I said with a shake of the head.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
&#8220;It&#8217;s only that I&#8217;m&mdash;I&#8217;m a trifle too chilly to be comfortable.&#8221;</p>
<p>And the foolish youth, at that, straightway fell to
stoking the fire. I had to laugh a little. And that
made him study me with solemn eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just think, Gershom,&#8221; I said as I gathered up
my sewing, &#8220;my heart is perishing of cold in a province
which is estimated to contain almost seventeen
per cent. of the world&#8217;s known coal supply!&#8221;</p>
<p>And that, apparently, left him with something to
think about as I made my way off to bed ... It&#8217;s
hard to write coherently, I find, when you&#8217;re not living
coherently ...</p>
<p>Syd Woodward, of Buckhorn, having learned that
I can drive a tractor, has asked me if I&#8217;ll take part in
the plowing-match to-morrow. And I&#8217;ve given my
promise to show Mere Man what a woman can do in
the matter of turning a mile-long furrow. I feel
rather audacious over it all. And I&#8217;m glad to inject
a little excitement into life ... I&#8217;m saving up for
a new sewing-machine ... Tarzanette has got
rather badly cut up in some of our barb-wire fencing.</p>

<p>The plowing-match was good fun, and I enjoyed it
even more than I had expected. The men &#8220;kidded&#8221;
me a good deal, and gave me a cheer at the end (I
don&#8217;t quite know whether it was for my work or my
costume) and I had to pose for photographs, and a
moving-picture man even followed me about for a
round, shooting me as I turned my prairie stubble
upside down. But the excitement of the plowing-match
has been eclipsed by a bit of news which has
rather taken my breath away. <i>It is Peter Ketley who
has bought the Harris Ranch.</i></p>

<h2><i>Saturday the Twenty-Third</i></h2>
</div>
<p>The rains have brought mushrooms, slathers of
mushrooms, and I joy in gathering them.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon I rode past the Harris
Ranch. The old place brought back a confusion of
memories. But I was most disturbed by the signs
of building going on there. It seems to mean a new
shack on Alabama Ranch. And a new shack of very
considerable dimensions. I&#8217;ve been wondering what
this implies. I don&#8217;t know whether to be elated or
depressed. And what business is it, after all, of
mine?</p>
<p>My Dinkie&mdash;I have altogether given up trying to
call my Dinkie anything but Dinkie&mdash;came home two
evenings ago with a discolored eye and a distinct air
of silence. Gershom, too, seemed equally reticent.
So I set about discreetly third-degreeing Poppsy,
who finally acknowledged, with awe in her voice, that
Dinkie had been in a fight.</p>
<p>It was, according to my petticoated Herodotus, a
truly terrible fight. Noses got bloodied, and no one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
could make the fighters stop. But Dinkie was unquestionably
the conqueror. Yet, oddly enough, I
am informed that he cried all through the combat.
He was a crying fighter. And he had his fight with
Climmie O&#8217;Lone&mdash;trust the Irish to look for trouble!&mdash;who
seems to have been accepted as the ring-master
of his younger clan. Their differences arose out of
the accusation that Dinkie, my bashful little Dinkie,
had been forcing his unwelcomed attention on one
Doreen O&#8217;Lone, Climmie&#8217;s younger sister. That&#8217;s
absurd, of course. And Dinkie must have realized it.
He didn&#8217;t want to fight, acknowledged Poppsy, from
the first. He even cried over it. And Doreen also
cried. And Poppsy herself joined in.</p>
<p>I fancy it was a truly Homeric struggle, for it
seems to have lasted for round after round. It
lasted, I have been able to gather, until Climmie was
worsted and down on his back crying &#8220;Enough!&#8221;
Which Poppsy reports Dinkie made him say three
times, until Doreen nodded and said she&#8217;d heard.
But my young son, apparently, is one of those crying
fighters, who are reckoned, if I remember right, as
the worst breed of belligerents!</p>
<p>I have decided not to tell Dinkie what I know.
But I&#8217;m rather anxious to get a glimpse of this young
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
Mistress Doreen, for whom lances are already being
shattered in the lists of youth. The O&#8217;Lones regard
themselves as the landed aristocracy of the Elk-trail
District. And Doreen O&#8217;Lone impresses me as a
very musical appellative. Yet I prefer to keep my
kin free from all entangling alliances, even though
they have to do with a cattle-king&#8217;s offspring....</p>
<p>I had a short letter from Dinky-Dunk to-day,
asking me to send on a package of papers which he
had left in a pigeon-hole of his desk here. It was a
depressingly non-committal little note, without a
glimmer of warmth between the lines. I&#8217;m afraid
there&#8217;s a certain ugly truth which will have to be
faced some day. But I intend to stick to the ship
as long as the ship can keep afloat. I am so essentially
a family woman that I can&#8217;t conceive of life
without its home circle. Home, however, is where the
heart is. And it seems to take more than one heart
to keep it going. I keep reminding myself that I
have my children at the same time that I keep asking
myself why my children are not enough, why they
can&#8217;t seem to fill my cup of contentment as they
ought. Now that their father is so much away, a
great deal of their training is falling on my shoulders.
And I must, in some way, be a model to them. So
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
I&#8217;ll continue to show them what a Penelope I can be.
Perhaps, after all, they will prove our salvation. For
our offspring ought to be the snow-fences along the
wind-harried rails of matrimony. They should prevent
drifting along the line, and from terminal to
lonely terminal should keep traffic open ... I have
to-night induced Poppsy to write a long and affectionate
letter to her <i>pater</i>, telling him all the news of
Casa Grande. Perhaps it will awaken a little pang
in the breast of her absent parent.</p>

<h2><i>Monday the Twenty-Fifth</i></h2>
</div>
<p>I have aroused the ire of the Dour Man. He has
sent me a message strongly disapproving of my conduct.
He even claims that I&#8217;ve humiliated him. I
never dreamed, when that movie-man with the camera
followed me about at the plowing-match, that my
husband would wander into a Calgary picture-house
and behold his wife in driving gauntlets and Stetson
mounted on a tractor and twiddling her fingers at the
camera-operator, just to show how much at home she
felt! Dinky-Dunk must have experienced a distinctly
new thrill when he saw his own wife come riding
through that pictorial news weekly. He would have
preferred not recognizing me, I suppose. But there
I was, duly named and labeled&mdash;and hence the ponderous
little note of disapproval.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;m not going to let Duncan start a quarrel
over trivialities like this. I intend to sit tight.
There&#8217;d be little use in argument, anyway, for Duncan
would only ignore me as the predatory tom-cat
ignores the foolishly scolding robin. I&#8217;m going to be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
a regular mallard, and stick to these home regions
until the ice forms. And our most mountainous
troubles, after all, can&#8217;t quite survive being exteriorated
through the ink-well. It relieves me to write
about them. But I wish I had a woman of my own
age to talk to. I get a bit lonely, now that winter
is slipping down out of the North again. And I
find that I&#8217;m not so companionable as I ought to be.
It comes home to me, now and then, how far away
from the world we are, how remote from everything
that counts. The tragedy of life with Chaddie
McKail, I suppose, is that she&#8217;s let existence narrow
down to just one thing, to her family. Other women
seem to have substitutes. But I&#8217;ve about forgotten
how to be a social animal. I seem to grow as segregative
as the timber-wolf. There&#8217;s nothing for me
in the woman&#8217;s club life one gets out here. I can&#8217;t
force myself into church work, and the rural reading-club
is something beyond me. I simply couldn&#8217;t
endure those Women&#8217;s Institute meetings which open
with a hymn and end up with sponge-cake and green
tea, after a platitudinous paper on the Beauty of
Prairie Life. It has its beauties, God knows, or we&#8217;d
all go mad. We women, in this brand-new land, try
to bolster ourselves up with the belief that we have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
greatnesses which the rest of the world must get
along without. But that is only the flaunting of
<i>La Panache</i>, the feather of courage in our cap of
discouragement. There is so much, so much, we are
denied! So much we must do without! So much we
must see go to others! So much we must never even
hope for! Oh, pioneers, great you are and great you
must be, to endure what you have endured! You
must be strong in your hours of secret questioning
and you must be strong in your quest for consolation.
If nothing else, you must at least be strong. And
these western men of ours should all be strong men,
should all be great men, because they must have been
the children of great mothers. A prairie mother
<i>has</i> to be a great woman. She must be great to
survive, to endure, to leave her progeny behind her.
I&#8217;ve heard the Wise Men talk about nature looking
after her own. I&#8217;ve heard sentimentalists sing about
the strength that lies in the soil. But, oh, pioneers,
you know what you know! In your secret heart of
hearts you remember the lonely hours, the lonely
years, the lonely graves! For in the matter of infant
mortality alone, prairie life shows a record shocking
to read. We are making that better, it is true, with
our district nursing and our motherhood clubs and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
our rural phones and our organized letting in of
light and passing on of knowledge. We are not so
overburdened as those nobler women who went before
us. But, oh, pioneers along these lonely northern
trails, I salute you and honor you for your courage!
Your greatness will never be known. It will be seen
only in the great country which you gave up your
lives to bring to birth!</p>

<h2><i>Wednesday the Twenty-Seventh</i></h2>
</div>
<p>What weather-cocks we are! My blue Monday is
over and done with, this is a crystalline winter day
with all the earth at peace with itself, and I&#8217;ve just
had a letter from Peter asking if I could take care
of his sister&#8217;s girl, Susie Mumford, until after Christmas.
The Mumfords, it seems, are going through
the divorce-mill, and Susie&#8217;s mother is anxious that
her one and only child should be afar from the scene
when the grist of liberty is a-grinding.</p>
<p>I know nothing of Susie except what Peter has told
me, that she is not yet nineteen, that she is intelligent,
but obstreperous, and much wiser than she pretends
to be, that the machinery of life has always run much
too smoothly about her for her own good, and that a
couple of months of prairie life might be the means
of introducing her to her own soul.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s all I know of Susie, but I shall welcome her
to Casa Grande. I&#8217;ll be glad to see a city girl again,
to talk over face-creams and the <i>Follies</i> and Tchaikowsky
and brassieres and Strindberg with. And
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span>
I&#8217;ll be glad to do a little toward repaying big-hearted
old Peter for all his kindnesses of the past. Susie
may be both sophisticated and intractable, but I
await her with joy. She seems almost the answer to
my one big want.</p>
<p>But Casa Grande, I have been realizing, will have
to be refurbished for its coming guest. We have
grown a bit shoddy about the edges here. It&#8217;s hard
to keep a house spick and span, with two active-bodied
children running about it. And my heart, I
suppose, has not been in that work of late. But I&#8217;ve
been on a tour of inspection, and I realize it&#8217;s time to
reform. So Struthers and I are about to doll up
these dilapidated quarters of ours. And I intend
to have my dolorously neglected Guest Room (for
such I used to call it) done over before the arrival
of Susie....</p>
<p>I rode over to the Teetzels&#8217; this afternoon, to
explain about our cattle getting through on their
land. It was the road-workers who broke down the
Teetzel fence, to squat on a coul&eacute;e-corner for their
camp. And they hadn&#8217;t the decency to restore what
they had wrecked. So Bud Teetzel and I rode seven
miles up the new turn-pike and overtook those road-workers
and I harangued their foreman for a full
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
fifteen minutes. But it made little impression on
him. He merely grinned and stared at me with a
sort of insolent admiration on his face. And when I
had finished he audibly remarked to one of his teamsters
that I made a fine figure of a woman on horseback.</p>
<p>Bud says they&#8217;re thinking of selling out if they can
get their price. The old folks want to move to Victoria,
and Bud and his brother have a hankering to
try their luck up in the Peace River District. I
asked Bud if he wouldn&#8217;t rather settle down in one
of the big cities. He merely laughed at me. &#8220;No
thank you, lady! This old prair-ee is comp&#8217;ny
enough for me!&#8221; he said as he loped, brown as a nut,
along the trail as tawny as a lion&#8217;s mane, with a sky
of steel-cold blue smiling down on his lopsided old
sombrero. I studied him with a less impersonal eye.
He was a handsome and husky young giant, with the
joy of life still frankly imprinted on his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bud,&#8221; I said as I loped along beside him, &#8220;why
haven&#8217;t you ever married?&#8221;</p>
<p>That made him laugh again. Then he turned
russet as he showed me the white of an eye.</p>
<p>&#8220;All the peaches seemed picked, in this district,&#8221;
he found the courage to proclaim.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span></p>
<p>This made me trot out the old platitude about the
fish in the sea being as good as any ever caught&mdash;and
there really ought to be an excise tax on platitudes,
for being addicted to them is quite as bad as
being addicted to alcohol, and quite as benumbing to
the brain.</p>
<p>But Bud, with his next speech, brought me up
short.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, lady, if <i>you</i> was still in the runnin&#8217; I&#8217;d give
&#8217;em a race that&#8217;d make a coyote look like a caterpillar
on crutches!&#8221;</p>
<p>He said it solemnly, and his solemnity kept it
respectful. But it was my turn to laugh. And
ridiculous as it may sound, this doesn&#8217;t impress me as
such a dark world as I had imagined! A woman,
after all, is a good deal like mother earth: each has
to be cultivated a little to keep it mellow.</p>
<p>... Where the Female is, there also is the Unexpected.
For when I got home I found that my
decorous Poppsy, my irreproachable Poppsy, had
succumbed before the temptation to investigate
my new sewing-machine. And once having nibbled
at the fruit of the tree of knowledge, she went
rampaging through the whole garden. She made
a stubborn effort to exhaust the possibilities of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
all the little hemmers, and tried the shirrer and
the fire-stitch ruffler, and obviously had a fling
at the binder and a turn at the tucker. What
she did to the tension-spring heaven only knows.
And my brand-new machine is on the blink. And my
meek-eyed little Poppsy isn&#8217;t as impeccable as the
world about her imagined!</p>

<h2><i>Wednesday the Third</i></h2>
</div>
<p>Susie Mumford arrived yesterday. The weather,
heaven be thanked, was perfect, an opal day with the
earth as fresh-smelling as Poppsy just out of her
bath. There was just enough chill in the air to make
one&#8217;s blood tingle and just enough warmth in the
sunlight to make it feel like a benediction. Whinstane
Sandy, in fact, avers that we&#8217;re in for a spell
of Indian Summer.</p>
<p>I motored in to Buckhorn and met Susie, who
wasn&#8217;t in the least what I expected. I was looking
for a high-spirited and insolent-eyed young lady
who&#8217;d probably be traveling with a French maid and
a van-load of trunks, after the manner of Lady
Alicia. But the Susie I met was a tired and listless
and rather white-faced girl who reminds me just
enough of her Uncle Peter to make me like her. The
poor child knows next to nothing of the continent on
which she was born, and the immensity of our West
has rather appalled her. She told me, driving home,
that she had never before been this side of the Adirondacks.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
Yet she has crossed the Atlantic eight times
and knows western Europe about as well as she knows
Long Island itself. There is a matter-of-factness
about Susie which makes her easy to get along with.
Poppsy took to her at once and was a garrulous and
happy witness of Susie&#8217;s unpacking. Dinkie, on the
other hand, developed an altogether unlooked-for
shyness and turned red when Susie kissed him. There
was no melting of the ice until the strange lady produced
a very wonderful toy air-ship, which you wind
up and which soars right over the haystacks, if you
start it right. This was a present which Peter sent
out. Dinkie, in fact, spent most of his spare time
last night writing a letter to his Uncle Peter, a letter
which he intimated he had no wish for the rest of the
family to read. He was willing to acknowledge, this
morning, that since he and Susie both had the same
Uncle Peter, they really ought to be cousins....</p>
<p>Susie has not been sleeping well, and for all her
weariness last night had to take five grains of veronal
before she could settle down. The result is that she
looks whiter than ever this morning and ate very
little of Struthers&#8217; really splendiferous breakfast.
But she made a valorous enough effort to be blithe
and has rambled about Casa Grande with the febrile,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
quick curiosity of a young setter, making friends
with the animals and for the first time in her life
picking an egg out of a nest. I was afraid, at first,
that she was going to complain about the quietness
of existence out here, for our pace must seem a slow
one, after New York. But Susie says the one thing
she wants is peace. It&#8217;s not often a girl not yet out
of her teens makes any such qualified demand on
life. I can&#8217;t help feeling that the break-up of her
family must be depressing her more than she pretends.
She speaks about it in a half-joking way,
however, and said this morning: &#8220;Dad certainly deserves
a little freedom!&#8221; We sat for an hour at the
breakfast-table, pow-wowing about everything under
the blessed sun.</p>
<p>In some ways Susie is a very mature woman, for
nineteen and three-quarters. She is also an exceptionally
companionable one. She has a sort of lapis-lazuli
eye with paler streaks in the iris, like banded
agate. It is a brooding eye, with a great deal of
beauty in it. And she has a magnolia-white skin
which one doesn&#8217;t often see on the prairie. It&#8217;s not
the sort of skin, in fact, which could last very long
on the open range. It&#8217;s the sort that&#8217;s had too much
bevel plate between it and the buffeting winds of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
world. But it&#8217;s lovely to look upon, especially when
it&#8217;s touched with its almost imperceptible shell-pink
of excitement as it was this afternoon when Susie
climbed on Buntie and tried a canter or two about
the corrals. Susie, I noticed, rode well. I couldn&#8217;t
quite make out why her riding made me at once think
of Theobald Gustav. But she explained, later, that
she had been taught by a German riding-master&mdash;and
then I understood.</p>
<p>But I must not overlook Gershom, who duly
donned his Sunday best in honor of Susie&#8217;s arrival
and who is already undertaking to educate the brooding-eyed
young lady from the East. He explained to
her that there were eight hundred and fifty thousand
square miles of Canada still unexplored, and Susie
said: &#8220;Then lead me into the most far-away part of
it!&#8221; And when he told her, during their first meal
together, that the human brain was estimated to contain
half a billion cells and that the number of brain
impressions collected by an average person during
fifty years of life aggregated three billion, one hundred
and fifty-five million, seven hundred and sixty
thousand, Susie sighed and said it was no wonder
women were so contradictory. Which impressed me
as very like one of my own retorts to Gershom. I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
saw Susie studying him, studying him with a quiet
and meditative eye. &#8220;I believe your Gershom is one
of the few good men in the world,&#8221; she afterward
acknowledged to me. And I&#8217;ve been wondering why
one so young should be saturated with cynicism.</p>
<p>A small incident occurred to-night which disturbed
me more than I can explain to myself. Susie, who
had been looking through one of Dinkie&#8217;s school
scribblers, guardedly passed the book over to me
where I sat sewing in front of the fire. For, whatever
may happen, a prairie mother can always find plenty
of sewing to do. I looked at the bottom of the page
which Susie pointed out to me. There I saw two
names, one above the other, with certain of the letters
stricken out, two names written like this:</p>
<div style='margin:5px auto; text-align:center;'>
<img alt='love and friendship cypher' src='images/illus-216.png' />
</div>
<p>And that set me off in a brown study which even
Susie seemed to fathom. She smiled understandingly
and turned and inspected Dinkie, bent over his arithmetic,
with an entirely new curiosity.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose that&#8217;s what every mother has to face,
some day,&#8221; she said as she sat down beside me in front
of the fire.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span></p>
<p>But it seemed a fire without warmth. Life, apparently,
had brought me to another of its Great
Divides. My boy had a secret apart from his
mother. My son was no longer all mine.</p>

<a name='FRIDAY_THE_FIFTH' id='FRIDAY_THE_FIFTH'></a>
<h2><i>Friday the Fifth</i></h2>
</div>
<p>This morning at breakfast, when Dinkie and I were
alone at the table, I crossed over to him and sat down
beside him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dinkie,&#8221; I said, with my hand on his tousled
young head, &#8220;whom do you love best in all the
world?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mummy!&#8221; he said, looking me straight in the eye.
And at that I drank in a deep breath.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you sure?&#8221; I demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;As sure as death and taxes,&#8221; he said with his
one-sided little smile. It was a phrase which his
father used to use, on similar occasions, in the long,
long ago. And it didn&#8217;t quite drive the mists out of
my heart.</p>
<p>&#8220;And who comes next?&#8221; I asked, with my hand still
on his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Buntie,&#8221; he replied, with what I suspected to be a
barricaded look on his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; I told him. &#8220;It has to be a human being.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then Poppsy,&#8221; he admitted.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And who next?&#8221; I persisted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whinnie!&#8221; exclaimed my son.</p>
<p>But I had to shake my head at that.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you forgetting somebody very important?&#8221;
I hinted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who?&#8221; he asked, deepening just a trifle in color.</p>
<p>&#8220;How about daddy?&#8221; I asked. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it about
time for him there?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, daddy,&#8221; he dutifully repeated. But his
face cleared, and my own heart clouded, as he went
through the empty rite.</p>
<p>Dinkie was studying that clouded face of mine, by
this time, and I began to feel embarrassed. But I
was determined to see the thing through. It was
hard, though, for me to say what I wanted to.</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t there somebody, somebody else you are
especially fond of?&#8221; I inquired, as artlessly as I
could. And it hurt like cold steel to think that I
had to fence with my own boy in such a fashion.</p>
<p>Dinkie looked at me and then he looked out of the
window.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I like Susie,&#8221; he finally admitted.</p>
<p>&#8220;But in your own life, Dinkie, in your work and
your play, in your school, isn&#8217;t&mdash;isn&#8217;t there <i>somebody</i>?&#8221;
I found the courage to ask.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span></p>
<p>Dinkie&#8217;s face grew thoughtful. For just a moment,
I thought I caught a touch of the Holbein Astronomer
in it.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s lots of boys and girls I like,&#8221; he noncommittally
asserted. And I began to see that it was
hopeless. My boy had reservations from his own
mother, reservations which I would be compelled to
respect. He was no longer entirely and unequivocally
mine. There was a wild-bird part of him which had
escaped, which I could never recapture and cage
again. The thing that his father had foretold was
really coming about. My laddie would some day
grow out of my reach. I would lose him. And my
happiness, which had been trying its wings for the
last few days, came down out of the sky like a shot
duck. All day long, for Susie&#8217;s sake, I&#8217;ve tried to
be light-hearted. But my efforts make me think of a
poor old worn-out movie-hall piano doing its pathetic
level best to be magnificently blithe. It&#8217;s a meaningless
clatter in a meaningless world.</p>

<h2><i>Thursday the Eleventh</i></h2>
</div>
<p>It ought to be winter, according to the almanac,
but our wonderful Indian Summer weather continues.
Susie and I have been &#8220;blue-doming&#8221; to-day. We converted
ourselves into a mounted escort for Gershom
and the kiddies as far as the schoolhouse, and then
rode on to Dead Horse Lake, in the hope of getting
a few duck. But the weather was too fine, though I
managed to bring down a couple of mallard, after
one of which Susie, having removed her shoes and
stockings, waded knee-deep in the slough. She enjoys
that sort of thing: it&#8217;s something so entirely new to
the child of the city. And Susie, I might add, is
already looking much better. She is sleeping soundly,
at last, and has promised me there shall be no more
night-caps of veronal. What is more, I am getting
to know her better&mdash;and I have several revisions to
make.</p>
<p>In the first place, it is not the family divorce cloud
that has been darkening Susie&#8217;s soul. She let the
cat out of the bag, on the way home this afternoon.
Susie has been in love with a man who didn&#8217;t come up
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
to expectations. She was very much in love, apparently,
and disregarded what people said about him.
Then, much to her surprise, her Uncle Peter took a
hand in the game. It must have been rather a violent
hand, for a person so habitually placid. But Peter,
apparently, wasn&#8217;t altogether ignorant of the club-talk
about the young rake in question. At any rate,
he decided it was about time to act. Susie declined
to explain in just what way he acted. Yet she
admits now that Peter was entirely in the right and
she, for a time, was entirely in the wrong. But it is
rather like having one&#8217;s appendix cut out, she protests,
without an anesthetic. It takes time to heal
such wounds. Susie obviously was bowled over. She
is still suffering from shock. But I like the spirit of
the girl. She&#8217;s not the kind that one disappointment
is going to kill. And prairie life is already doing her
good. For she announced this morning that her
clothes were positively getting tight for her. And
such clothes they are! Such delicate silks and cobwebs
of lace and pale-pink contraptions of satin!
Such neatly tailored skirts and short-vamped shoes
and thing-a-ma-jigs of Irish linen and platinum and
gold trinkets to deck out her contemptuous little
body with. For Susie takes them all with a shrug
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
of indifference. She loves to slip on my oil-stained
old hunting-jacket and my weather-beaten old golf-boots
and go meandering about the range.</p>
<p>Another revision which I am compelled to make is
that while I expected to be the means of cheering
Susie up, Susie has quite unconsciously been the
means of rejuvenating <i>me</i>. I think I&#8217;ve been able to
catch at least a hollow echo of her youth from her.
I <i>know</i> I have. Two days ago, when we motored in
to Buckhorn with my precious marketing of butter
and eggs&mdash;and Susie never before quite realized how
butter and eggs reached the ultimate consumer&mdash;a
visiting Odd-Fellows&#8217; band was playing a two-step
on the balcony of the Commercial Hotel. Susie and
I stopped the car, and while Struthers stared at us
aghast from the back seat, we two-stepped together
on the main street of Buckhorn. We just let the
music go to our heads and danced there until the
crowd in front of the band began to right-about-face
and a cowboy in chaps brazenly announced that he
was Susie&#8217;s next partner. So we danced to our running-board,
stepped into our devil-wagon, and headed
for home, in the icy aura of Struthers&#8217; sustained indignation.</p>
<p>I begin to get terribly tired of propriety. I don&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
know whether it&#8217;s Struthers, or Struthers and Gershom
combined, or having to watch one&#8217;s step so when
there are children about one. But I&#8217;m tired of being
respectable. I&#8217;m tired of holding myself in. I warn
the world that I&#8217;m about ready for anything, anything
from horse-stealing to putting a dummy-lady
in Whinstane Sandy&#8217;s bed. I don&#8217;t believe there&#8217;s
any wickedness that&#8217;s beyond me. I&#8217;m a reckless and
abandoned woman. And if that cold-blooded old
Covenanter doesn&#8217;t get home from Calgary pretty
soon I&#8217;m going buckboard riding with Bud Teetzel!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been asking Susie if we measure up to her
expectations. She said, in reply, that we fitted in to
a T. For her Uncle Peter, she acknowledged, had
already done us in oils on the canvas of her curiosity.
She accused me, however, of reveling in that primitiveness
which is the last resort of the sophisticated&mdash;like
the log cabins the city folk fashion for themselves
when they get up in the Adirondacks. And Casa
Grande, she further amended, impressed her as being
almost disappointingly comfortable.</p>
<p>After that Susie fell to talking about Peter. She
is affectionately contemptuous toward her uncle, protesting
that he&#8217;s forever throwing away his chances
and letting other people impose on his good nature.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
It was lucky, averred Susie, that he was born with a
silver spoon in his mouth. For he was a hopeless
espouser of Lost Causes. She inclined to the belief
that he should have married young, should have married
young and had a flock of children, for he was
crazy about kiddies.</p>
<p>I asked Susie what sort of wife Peter should have
chosen. And Susie said Peter should have hitched up
with a good, capable, practical-minded woman who
could manage him without letting him know he was
being managed. There was a widow in the East,
acknowledged his niece, who had been angling for
poor Peter for years. And Peter was still free,
Susie suspected, because in the presence of that
widow he emulated Hamlet and always put an antic
disposition on. Did the most absurd things, and appeared
to be little more than half-witted. The widow
in question had even spoken to Susie about her uncle&#8217;s
eccentricities and intimated that his segregative manner
of life might in the end affect his intellect!</p>
<p>The thought of Peter marrying rather gave me a
shock. It was like being told by some authority in
astronomy that your earth was about to collide with
Wernecke&#8217;s Comet. And, vain peacock that I was, I
rather liked to think of Peter going through life
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span>
mourning for me, alone and melancholy and misogynistic
for the rest of his days! Yet there must be
dozens, there must be hundreds, of attractive girls
along the paths which he travels. I found the courage
to mention this fact to Susie, who merely laughed
and said her Uncle Peter would probably be saved by
his homeliness. But I can&#8217;t say that I ever regarded
Peter Ketley as homely. He may never carry off a
blue ribbon from a beauty show, but he has the sort
of face that a woman of sense can find tremendous
appeal in. Your flapper type, I suppose, will always
succumb to the curled Romeo, but it&#8217;s the ruggeder
and stronger man with the bright mind and the
kindly heart who will always appeal to the clearer-eyed
woman who has come to know life.... Susie
has told me, by the way, that Josie Langdon and her
husband quarreled on their honeymoon, quarreled
the first week in Paris and right across the Continent
for the momentous reason that Josie <i>insisted on putting
sugar in her claret</i>!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been doing a good deal of thinking, the last
few hours. I&#8217;ve been wondering if I&#8217;m a Lost Cause.
And I&#8217;ve been wondering why women should want to
put sugar in their claret. If it&#8217;s made to be bitter,
why not accept the bitterness, and let it go at that?</p>

in to Buckhorn for him.</p>
<p>It impresses me as a non-committal little message,
yet it means more to me than I imagined. <i>My husband
is coming home.</i></p>
<p>Susie has been eying me all afternoon, with a
pucker of perplexity about her lapis-lazuli eyes. We
are busy, getting things to rights. And I&#8217;ve made an
appallingly long list of what I must buy in Buckhorn
to-morrow. Even Struthers has perked up a bit, and
is making furtive preparations for a sage-tea wash in

</div>
<p>Why is life so tangled up? Why can&#8217;t we be either
completely happy or completely the other way?
Why must wretchedness come sandwiched in between
slices of hope and contentment, and why must happiness
be haunted by some ghostly echo of pain?
And why can&#8217;t people be all good or all bad, so that
the tares and the wheat never get mixed up together
and make a dismal mess of our harvest of Expectation?</p>
<p>These are some of the questions I&#8217;ve been asking
myself since Duncan went back to Calgary last night.
He stayed only two days. And they were days of
terribly complicated emotions. I went to the station
for him, on Saturday, and in my impatience to be
there on time found myself with an hour and a half
of waiting, an hour and a half of wandering up and
down that ugly open platform in the clear cool light
of evening. There was a hint of winter in the air, an
intimidating northern nip which made the thought
of a warm home and an open fire a consolation to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
chilled heart. And I felt depressed, in spite of everything
I could do to bolster up my courage. In the
first place, I couldn&#8217;t keep from thinking of Alsina
Teeswater. And in the second place, never, never on
the prairie, have I watched a railway-train come in
or a railway-train pass away without feeling lonesome.
It reminds me how big is the outside world,
how infinitesimal is Chaddie McKail and her unremembered
existence up here a thousand miles from
Nowhere! It humbles me. It reminds me that I have
in some way failed to mesh in with the bigger machinery
of life.</p>
<p>I had a lump in my throat, by the time Dinky-Dunk&#8217;s
train pulled in and I saw him swing down
from the car-steps. I made for him through the
crowd, in fact, with my all but forgotten Australian
crawl-stroke, and accosted him with rather a briny
kiss and so tight a hug that he stood back and studied
my face. He wanted to ask, I know, if anything
had happened. He was obviously startled, and just
a trifle embarrassed. My lump, by this time, was
bigger than ever, but I had to swallow it in secret.
Dinky-Dunk, I found, was changed in many ways.
He was tired, and he seemed older. But he was prosperous-looking,
in brand-new raiment, and reported
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
that luck was still with him and everything was flourishing.
Give him one year, he protested, and he&#8217;d
show them he wasn&#8217;t a piker.</p>
<p>I waited for him to ask about the children, but his
mind seemed full of his Barcona coal business. The
railway was learning to treat them half decently and
the coal was coming out better than they&#8217;d hoped for.
They&#8217;d a franchise to light the town, developing
their power from the mine screenings, and what they
got from this would be so much velvet. And he had a
chance to take over one of the finest houses in Mount
Royal, if he had a family along with him to excuse
such magnificence.</p>
<p>That final speech of his brought me up short. It
was dark along the trail, and dark in my heart. And
more things than one had happened that day to
humble me. So I took one hand off the wheel and put
it on his knee.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you want me to go to Calgary?&#8221; I asked him.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s up to you,&#8221; he said, without budging an
inch. He said it, in fact, with a steel-cold finality
which sent my soul cringing back into its kennel.
And the trail ahead of me seemed blacker than ever.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll have to have time to think it over,&#8221; I said with
a composure which was nine-tenths pretense.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Some wives,&#8221; he remarked, &#8220;are willing to help
their husbands.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know it, Dinky-Dunk,&#8221; I acknowledged, hoping
against hope he&#8217;d give me the opening I was looking
for. &#8220;And I want to help, if you&#8217;ll only let me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I&#8217;m doing my part,&#8221; he rather solemnly
asserted. I couldn&#8217;t see his face, in the dark, but
there was little hope to be wrung from the tone of
his voice. So I knew it would be best to hold my
peace.</p>
<p>Casa Grande blazed a welcome to us, as we drove
up to it, and the children, thank heaven, were relievingly
boisterous over the adventure of their dad&#8217;s
return. He seemed genuinely amazed at their growth,
seemed slightly irritated at Dinkie&#8217;s long stares of
appraisal, and feigned an interest in the paraded new
possessions of Poppsy and her brother&mdash;until it
came to Peter&#8217;s toy air-ship, which was thrust almost
bruskly aside.</p>
<p>And that reminds me of one thing which I am reluctant
to acknowledge. Dinky-Dunk was anything
but nice to Susie. He may have his perverse reasons
for disliking everything in any way connected with
Peter Ketley, but I at least expected my husband to
be agreeable to the casual guest under his roof.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
Through it all, I must confess, Susie was wonderful.
She made no effort to ignore Duncan, as his ignoring
of her only too plainly merited. She remained, not
only poised and imperturbable, but impersonal and
impenetrable. She found herself, I think, driven
just a tiny bit closer to Gershom, who still shows a
placid exterior to Duncan&#8217;s slightly contemptuous
indifference.</p>
<p>My husband, I&#8217;m afraid, was not altogether happy
in his own home. In one way, of course, I can not
altogether blame him for that, since his bigger interests
now are outside that home. But I begin to see
how dangerous these long separations can be. Somewhere
and at some time, before too much water runs
under the bridges, there will have to be a readjustment.</p>
<p>I realized that, in fact, as I drove Duncan back to
the station last night, after I&#8217;d duly signed the different
papers he&#8217;d brought for that purpose. I had
a feeling that every chug of the motor was carrying
him further and further out of my life. Heaven
knows, I was willing enough to eat crow. I was ready
to bury the hatchet, and bury it in my own bosom,
if need be, rather than see it swinging free to strike
some deeper blow.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Dinky-Dunk,&#8221; I said after a particularly long
silence between us, &#8220;what is it you want me to do?&#8221;</p>
<p>My heart was beating much faster than he could
have imagined and I was grateful for the chance to
pretend the road was taking up most of my attention.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do about what?&#8221; he none too encouragingly inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t seem to be hitting it off the way we
should be,&#8221; I went on, speaking as quietly as I was
able. &#8220;And I want you to tell me where I&#8217;m failing to
do my share.&#8221;</p>
<p>That note of humility from me must have surprised
him a little, for we rode quite a distance without
a word.</p>
<p>&#8220;What makes you feel that way?&#8221; he finally asked.</p>
<p>I found it hard to answer that question. It would
never be easy, at any rate, to answer it as I wanted to.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because things can&#8217;t go on this way forever,&#8221; I
found the courage to tell him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; he asked. He seemed indifferent
again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because they&#8217;re all wrong,&#8221; I rather tremulously
replied. &#8220;Can&#8217;t you see they&#8217;re all wrong?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But why do you want them changed?&#8221; he asked
with a disheartening sort of impersonality.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span></p>
<p>&#8220;For the sake of the children,&#8221; I told him. And
I could feel the impatient movement of his body on the
car seat beside me.</p>
<p>&#8220;The children!&#8221; he repeated with acid-drop deliberation.
&#8220;The children, of course! It&#8217;s always the
children!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re still their father,&#8221; I reminded him.</p>
<p>&#8220;A sort of honorary president of the family,&#8221; he
amended.</p>
<p>Hope ebbed out of my heart, like air out of a
punctured tire.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you making it rather hard for me?&#8221; I
demanded, trying to hold myself in, but feeling the
bob-cat getting the better of the purring tabby.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve rather concluded that was the way you made
it for <i>me</i>,&#8221; countered Duncan, with a coolness of manner
which I came more and more to resent.</p>
<p>&#8220;In what way?&#8221; I asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;In shutting up shop,&#8221; he rather listlessly responded.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think I quite understand,&#8221; I told him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, in crowbarring me out of your scheme of
life, if you insist on knowing,&#8221; were the words that
came from the husband sitting so close beside me.
&#8220;You had your other interests, of course. But you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
also seem to have had the idea that you could turn me
loose like a range horse. I could paw for my fodder
and eat snow when I got thirsty. You didn&#8217;t even
care to give me a wind-break to keep a forty-mile
blizzard out of my bones. You didn&#8217;t know where I
was browsing, and didn&#8217;t much care. It was up to
me to rustle for myself and be rounded up when the
winter was over and there was another spell of work
on hand!&#8221;</p>
<p>We rode on in silence, for almost a mile, with the
cold air beating against my body and a colder numbness
creeping about the corner of my heart.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mean, Dinky-Dunk,&#8221; I finally asked,
&#8220;that you want your freedom?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not saying that,&#8221; he said, after another short
silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then what is it you want?&#8221; I asked, wondering
why the windshield should look so blurred in the
half-light.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to get something out of life,&#8221; was his embittered
retort.</p>
<p>It was a retort that I thought over, thought over
with an oddly settling mind, like a stirred pool that
has been left to clear itself. For that grown man
sitting there beside me seemed ridiculously like a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
spoiled child, an indulged child forlornly alone in the
fogs of his own arrogance. He made me think of a
black bear which bites at the bullet wound in his own
body. I felt suddenly sorry for him, in a maternal
sort of way. I felt sorry for him at the same time
that I remained a trifle afraid of him, for he still possessed,
I knew, his black-bear power of inflicting unlooked-for
and ursine blows. I simply ached to swing
about on him and say: &#8220;Dinky-Dunk, what you need
is a good spanking!&#8221; But I didn&#8217;t have the courage.
I had to keep my sense of humor under cover, just as
you have to blanket garden-geraniums before the
threat of a black frost. Yet, oddly enough, I felt
fortified by that sense of pity. It seemed to bring
with it the impression that Duncan was still a small
boy who might some day grow out of his badness. It
made me feel suddenly older and wiser than this overgrown
child who was still crying for the moon. And
with that feeling came a wave of tolerance, followed
by a smaller wave of faith, of faith that everything
might yet come out right, if only I could learn to be
patient, as mothers are patient with children.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I, on my part, Dinky-Dunk, want to see you
get the very best out of life,&#8221; I found myself saying
to him. My intentions were good, but I suppose I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
made my speech in a very superior and school-teachery
sort of way.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess I&#8217;ve got about all that&#8217;s coming to me,&#8221;
he retorted, with the note of bitterness still in his
voice.</p>
<p>And again I had the feeling of sitting mother-wise
and mother-patient beside an unruly small boy.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s much more, Dinky-Dunk, if you only ask
for it,&#8221; I said as gently as I was able.</p>
<p>He turned, at that, and studied me in the failing
light, studied me with a sharp look of interrogation
on his face. I had the feeling, as he did so, of something
epochal in the air, as though the drama of life
were narrowing up to its climactic last moment. Yet
I felt helpless to direct the course of that drama.
I nursed the impression that we stood at the parting
of the ways, that we stood hesitating at the fork of
two long and lonely trails which struck off across an
illimitable world, farther and farther apart. I
vaguely regretted that we were already in the streets
of Buckhorn, for I was half hoping that Duncan
would tell me to stop the car. Then I vaguely regretted
that I was busy driving that car, as otherwise
I might have been free to get my arms about that
granitic Dour Man of mine and strangle him into
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
submitting to that momentary mood of softness
which seems to come less and less to the male as he
grows older.</p>
<p>But Duncan merely laughed, a bit uneasily, and
just as suddenly grew silent again. I had a sense of
asbestos curtains coming down between us, coming
down before the climax was reached or the drama
was ended. I couldn&#8217;t help wondering, as we drove
into the cindered station-yard where the lights were
already twinkling, if Dinky-Dunk, like myself, sat
waiting for something which failed to manifest itself,
if he too had held back before the promise of some
decisive word which I was without the power to utter.
For we were only half-warm, the two of us, toying
with the ghosts of the dead past and childishly afraid
of the future. We were Laodiceans, neither hot nor
cold, without the primal hunger to reach out and
possess what we too timidly desired. We were more
neutral even than Ferdinand and the Lady of the
Bust, for we no longer cared sufficiently to let the
other know we cared, but waited and waited in that
twilight where all cats are gray.</p>
<p>There was, mercifully, very little time left for us
before the train came in. We kept our masks on, and
talked only of every-day things, about the receipt
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span>
for the ranch taxes and what steers Whinnie should
&#8220;finish&#8221; and the new granary roof and the fire-lines
about the haystacks. Without quite knowing it,
when the train pulled in, I put my arm through my
husband&#8217;s&mdash;and for the second time that evening he
turned sharply and inspected my face. I felt as
though I wanted to hold him back, to hold him back
from something unescapable but tragically momentous.
I think he felt sorry for me. At any rate,
after he had swung his suit-case up on the car-platform,
he turned and kissed me good-by. But it was
the sort of kiss one gets at funerals. It left me
standing there watching the tail-lights blink off down
the track, as desolate as though I had been left alone
on the deadest promontory of the deadest planet
lost in space. I stood there until the lights were
gone. I stood there until the platform was empty
again and my car was the only car left along the
hard-packed cinders. So I climbed into the driving-seat,
and pulled on my gauntlets, and headed for
home....</p>
<p>Back at Casa Grande I found Dinkie and Whinnie
beside the bunk-house stove, struggling companionably
through the opening chapters of <i>Treasure
Island</i>. My boy smiled up at me, for a moment, but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
his mind, I could see, was intent on the page along
which Whinnie&#8217;s stubbled finger was crawling like a
plowshare beside each furrow of text. He was in
the South Pacific, a thousand miles away from me.
In my own house Struthers was putting a petulant-voiced
Poppsy to bed, and Gershom, up in his room,
was making extraordinary smells at his chemistry
experiments. Susie I found curled comfortably up in
front of the fire, idling over my first volume of <i>Jean
Christophe</i>.</p>
<p>She read three sentences aloud as I sat down beside
her. &#8220;How happy he is! He is made to be happy!...Life
will soon see to it that he is brought to
reason.&#8221;</p>
<p>She seemed to expect some comment from me, but
I found myself with nothing to say. In fact, we both
sat there for a long time, staring in silence at the
fire.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why do you live with a man you don&#8217;t love?&#8221; she
suddenly asked out of the utter stillness.</p>
<p>It startled me, that question. It also embarrassed
me, for I could feel my color mount as Susie&#8217;s lapis-lazuli
eyes rested on my face.</p>
<p>&#8220;What makes you think I don&#8217;t love him?&#8221; I
countered, reminding myself that Susie, after all,
was still a girl in her teens.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not a matter of thinking,&#8221; was Susie&#8217;s quiet
retort. &#8220;I <i>know</i> you don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I wish I could be equally certain,&#8221; I said
with a defensive stiffening of the lines of dignity.</p>
<p>But Susie smiled rather wearily at my forlorn little
parade of <i>hauteur</i>. Then she looked at the fire.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s hell, isn&#8217;t it, being a woman?&#8221; she finally
observed, unconsciously paraphrasing a much older
philosopher.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sometimes,&#8221; I admitted.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see why you stand it,&#8221; was her next meditative
shaft in my direction.</p>
<p>&#8220;What would you do about it?&#8221; I guardedly inquired.</p>
<p>Susie&#8217;s face took on one of its intent looks. She
was only in her teens, but life, after all, hadn&#8217;t dealt
over-lightly with her. She impressed me, at the
moment, as a secretly ardent young person whose
hard-glazed little body might be a crucible of incandescent
though invisible emotions.</p>
<p>&#8220;What would you do about it?&#8221; I repeated, wondering
what gave some persons the royal right of
doing the questionable and making it seem unquestionable.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Live!</i>&#8221; said Susie with quite unlooked-for emphasis.
&#8220;<i>Live</i>&mdash;whatever it costs!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t you regard this as living?&#8221; I asked,
after a moment of thought.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not as you ought to be,&#8221; averred Susie.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; I parried.</p>
<p>Susie sighed. She began to see that it was beyond
argument, I suppose. Then she too had her period
of silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;But what are you getting out of it?&#8221; she finally
demanded. &#8220;What is going to happen? What ever
<i>has</i> happened?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To whom?&#8221; I asked, resenting the unconscious
cruelty of her questioning.</p>
<p>&#8220;To you,&#8221; was the reply of the hard-glazed young
hedonist confronting me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you flattering me with the inference that I
was cut out for better things?&#8221; I interrogated as my
gaze met Susie&#8217;s. It was her turn to color up a bit.
Then she sighed again, and shook her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t suppose it&#8217;s doing either of us one earthly
bit of good,&#8221; she said with a listless small smile of
atonement. &#8220;And I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221;</p>
<p>So we let the skeletons stalk away from our pleasant
fireside and secrete themselves in their customary
closets of silence.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;ve been thinking a good deal about that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span>
question of Susie&#8217;s. What <i>has</i> happened to me, out
here on the prairie? What has indeed come into my
life?...</p>
<p>I married young and put a stop to those romantic
adventurings which enrich the lives of most girls and
enlighten the days of many women. I married a man
and lived with him in a prairie shack, and sewed and
baked for him, and built a new home and lost it, and
began over again. I had children, and saw one of
them die, and felt my girlhood slip away, and sold
butter and eggs, and loved the man of my choice and
cleaved to him and planned for my children, until I
saw the man of my choice love another woman. And
still I clung to my sparless hulk of a home, hoping
to hold close about me the children I had brought into
the world and would some day lose again to the
world. And that was all. That was everything. It
is true, nothing much has ever happened to me....</p>
<p>But I stop, to think this over. If these are the
small things, then what are the big things of life?
What is it that other women get? I have sung and
been happy; I have known great joy and walked big
with Hope. I have loved and been loved. I have
known sorrow, and I have known birth, and I have sat
face to face with death. I have, after all, pretty well
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
run the whole gamut, without perhaps realizing it.
For these, after all, are the big things, the elemental
things, of life. They are the basic things which leave
scant room for the momentary fripperies and the
hand-made ornaments of existence....</p>
<p>Heigho! I seem to grow into a melancholy
Jacques with the advancing years. That&#8217;s the way of
life, I suppose. But I&#8217;ve no intention of throwing
up the sponge. If I can no longer get as much fun
out of the game as I want, I can at least watch my
offspring taking their joy out of it. God be thanked
for giving us our children! We can still rest our
tired old eyes on them, just as the polisher of precious
stones used to keep an emerald in front of him, to
relieve his strained vision by gazing at its soft and
soothing greenness.</p>
<p>I have just crept in to take a look at my precious
Dinkie, fast asleep in the old cast-iron crib that is
growing so small for him he has to lie catercornered
on his mattress. He seemed so big, stretched out
there, that he frightened me with the thought he
couldn&#8217;t be a child much longer. There are no babies
left now in my home circle. And I still have a shamefaced
sort of hankering to hold a baby in my arms
again!</p>

<a name='WEDNESDAY_THE_THIRTYFIRST' id='WEDNESDAY_THE_THIRTYFIRST'></a>
<h2><i>Wednesday the Thirty-First</i></h2>
</div>
<p>Susie has promised to stay with us until after
Christmas. And the holidays, I realize, are only
a few weeks away. Struthers is knitting a sweater
of flaming red and rather grimly acknowledged,
when I pinned her down, that it was for Whinstane
Sandy. There was a snow-flurry Sunday, and
Gershom took Susie riding in the old cutter, scratching
grittily along the half-covered trails but apparently
enjoying it. My poor little Poppsy, who
rather idolizes Gershom, is transparently jealous of
his attentions to Susie. Yet Gershom, I know, is
nice to Susie and nothing more. He is still my loyal
but carefully restrained knight. It&#8217;s a shame, I suppose,
to bobweasel him the way I occasionally do.
But I can&#8217;t quite help it. His goody-goodiness is as
provocative to my baser nature as a red flag to an
Andulasian bull. And a woman who was once reckoned
as a heart-breaker has to keep her hand in with
<i>something</i>. I&#8217;ve got to convince myself that the last
shot hasn&#8217;t gone from the locker which Duncan
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
Argyll McKail once rifled. I spoiled Gershom&#8217;s supper
for him the other night by asking what it was
made some people have such a mysterious influence
over other people. And I caught him up short, last
Sunday morning, when he tried to argue that I was
a sort of paragon in petticoats.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you run away with the idea I&#8217;m that kind
of an angel,&#8221; I promptly assured him. &#8220;I&#8217;m an outlaw,
from saddle to sougan, and I can buck like a
bear fightin&#8217; bees. I&#8217;m a she-devil crow-hopping
around in skirts. And I could bu&#8217;st every commandment
slap-bang across my knee, once I got started,
and leave a trail of crime across the fair face of
nature that would make an old Bow-Gun vaquero&#8217;s
back-hair stand up. I&#8217;m just a woman, Gershom, a
little lonely and a little loony, and there&#8217;s so much
backed-up bad in me that once the dam gives way
there&#8217;ll be a hell-roaring old whoop-up along these
dusty old trails!&#8221;</p>
<p>Gershom turned white.</p>
<p>&#8220;But there&#8217;s your little ones to think of,&#8221; he
quaveringly reminded me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, there&#8217;s my little ones to think of,&#8221; I echoed,
wondering where I&#8217;d heard that familiar old refrain
before. My bark, after all, is much worse than my

bite. About all I can do is take things out in talk.
I&#8217;m only a faded beauty, brooding over my antique
adventures as a heart-breaker. But I know of one
heart I&#8217;d still like to break&mdash;if I had the power. No;
not break; but bend up to the cracking point!</p>

<h2><i>Monday the Nineteenth</i></h2>
</div>
<p>How Time takes wing for the busy! It&#8217;s only six
days to Christmas and I&#8217;ve still my box to get off
for Olga and her children. We&#8217;ve sent to Peter some
really charming snap-shots of the children, which
Susie took. The general effect of one, I must
acknowledge, is seriously damaged by the presence
of their Mummy.</p>
<p>Dinky-Dunk doubts if he&#8217;ll be able to get home for
the holidays. But I sent him a box, on Saturday,
made up of those things which he likes best to eat
and a set of the children&#8217;s pictures, nicely mounted.
I&#8217;ve also had Dinkie and Poppsy write a long letter
to their dad, a task which they performed with more
constraint than I had anticipated. I had my own
difficulties, along the same line, for I had taken a
photograph of poor little Pee-Wee&#8217;s grave with a
snow-drift across one end of it, and had written on
the bottom of the mounting-card: &#8220;<i>We must remember.</i>&#8221;
But as I stood studying this, before putting
it in next to Poppsy&#8217;s huge Christmas-card gay with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span>
powdered mica I felt a foolish tear or two run down
my cheek. And I realized it would never do to cloud
my Dinky-Dunk&#8217;s day with memories which might not
be altogether happy. So I&#8217;ve kept the picture of the
little white-fenced bed with the white snow-drift across
its foot....</p>
<p>Susie is in bed with a bad cold, which she caught
studying astronomy with Gershom. Poppsy was not
in the least put out when she watched me preparing
a mustard-plaster for the invalid. My daughter, I
am persuaded, has a revived faith in the operation of
retributive justice. But I hope Susie is better by
the holiday. Whinnie has the Christmas Tree hidden
away in the stable, and already a number of mysterious
parcels have arrived at Casa Grande. Bud
Teetzel very gallantly sent me over a huge turkey, an
eighteen-pounder, and to-morrow I have to go into
Buckhorn for my mail-order shipments. We have
decorated the house with a whole box of holly from
Victoria and I&#8217;ve hung a sprig of mistletoe in the
living-room doorway. The children, of course, are
on tiptoe with expectation. But I can&#8217;t escape the
impression that I&#8217;m merely acting a part, that I&#8217;m a
Pagliacci in petticoats. Heaven knows I clown
enough; no one can accuse me of not going through
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
the gestures. But it seems like fox-trotting along
the deck of a sinking ship.</p>
<p>I stood under the mistletoe, this morning, and
dared Gershom to kiss me. He turned quite white
and made for the door. But I caught him by the
coat, like Potiphar&#8217;s wife, and pulled him back to the
authorizing berry-sprig and gave him a brazen big
smack on the cheek-bone. He turned a sunset pink,
at that, and marched out of the room without saying
a word. But he was shaking his head as he went, at
my shamelessness, I suppose. Poor old Gershom!
I wish there were more men in the world like him.
The other day Susie intimated that he was too homosexual
and that it was the polygamous wretches who
really kept the world going. But I refuse to subscribe
to that sophomoric philosophy of hers which
would divide the race into fools and knaves. &#8220;It&#8217;s
safer being sane than mad; it&#8217;s better being good
than bad!&#8221; as Robert remarked. And I know at least
one strong man who is not bad; and one bad man who
is not strong.</p>

<h2><i>Tuesday the Twenty-Seventh</i></h2>
</div>
<p>The great Day has come and gone. And I&#8217;m not
sorry. There was a cloud over my heart that kept
me from getting the happiness out of it I ought. I
hoped we would hear from Peter, but for the first
time in history he overlooked us.</p>
<p>Dinky-Dunk, as he had warned us, could not get
home for the holidays. But he surprised me by sending
a really wonderful box for the kiddies, and even
a gorgeous silver-mounted collar for Scotty. Susie
is up again, but she is still feeling a bit listless. I
heard Gershom informing her to-night that her blood
travels at the rate of seven miles per hour and that if
all the energy of Niagara Falls were utilized it could
supply the world with seven million horse-power. I
do wish Gershom would get over trying to pat the
world on the head, instead of shaking hands with it!
I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;m losing my lilt. I can&#8217;t understand
why I should keep feeling as blue as indigo. I am
a well of acid and a little sister to the crab-apple. I
think I&#8217;ll make Susie come down so we can humanize
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span>
ourselves with a little music. For I feel like a Marie
Bashkirtseff with a bilious attack....</p>
<p>Whinstane Sandy has just come in with Peter&#8217;s
box, two days late. I felt sure that Peter would not
utterly forget us. There is still a great deal of
shouting down in the kitchen, where that most miraculous
of boxes has been unpacked. As for myself,
I&#8217;ve had a hankering to be alone, to think things over.
But my meditations don&#8217;t seem to get me anywhere....
Dinkie has just come up to show me his brand-new
bridle for Buntie. It is a magnificent bridle, as
shiny and jingly as any lad could desire. I tried to
get him to put it down, so that I could draw him over
close to me and talk to him. But Dinkie is too excited
for any such demonstration. He&#8217;s beginning, I&#8217;m
afraid, to consider emotion a bit unmanly. He seems
to be losing his craving to be petted and pampered.
There are times, I can see, when he desires his fence-lines
to be respected.</p>

<h2><i>Sunday the Twenty-Ninth</i></h2>
</div>
<p>Nearly six weeks, I notice, have slipped by. For
a month and a half, apparently, the impulse to air
my troubles went hibernating with the bears. Yet it
has been a mild winter, so far, with very little snow
and a great deal of sunshine&mdash;a great deal of sunshine
which doesn&#8217;t elate me as it ought. I can&#8217;t
remember who it was said a happy people has no history.
But that&#8217;s not true of a happy woman. It&#8217;s
when her heart is full that she makes herself heard,
that she sings like a lark to the world. When she&#8217;s
wretched, she retires with her grief....</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t been altogether wretched, it&#8217;s true, just
as I haven&#8217;t been altogether hilarious, but it disturbs
me to find that for a month and a half I haven&#8217;t
written a line in this, the mottled old book of my life.
It&#8217;s not that the last month or two has been empty,
for no months are really empty. They have to be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
filled with something. But there are times, I suppose,
when lives lie fallow, the same as fields lie fallow, times
when the days drag like harrow-teeth across the perplexed
loam of our soul and nothing comes of it at
all. Not, I repeat, that I have been momentously
unhappy. It&#8217;s more that a sort of sterilizing indifferency
took possession of me and made the little ups
and downs of existence as unworthy of record as the
ups and downs of the waves on the deadest shores of
the Dead Sea. It&#8217;s not that I&#8217;m idle, and it&#8217;s not
that I&#8217;m old, and it&#8217;s not that there&#8217;s anything wrong
with this disappointingly healthy body of mine. But
I rather think I need a change of some kind. I even
envy Susie, who has ambled on to the Coast and is staying
with the Lougheeds in Victoria, playing golf and
picking winter roses and writing back about her trips
up Vancouver Island and her approaching journey
down into California.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do we know of the New World,&#8221; she parodied
in her last letter that came to me, &#8220;who only the
old East know?&#8221; Then she goes on to say: &#8220;I&#8217;m
just back from a West Coast trip on the roly-poly
<i>Maquinna</i> and if my thoughts go wobbly and my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
hand goes crooked it&#8217;s because my head is so prodigiously
full of</p>

<div style='margin:2px auto; text-align:center;'>
<img alt='large-S image' src='images/illus-255.png' />
</div>

<p>and alas, also <i>Seasickness</i>, that I can&#8217;t think
straight!&#8221;</p>
<p>Susie&#8217;s soul, apparently, has had the dry-shampoo
it was in need of. But as for me, I&#8217;m like an old
horse-shoe with its calks worn off. The Master-Blacksmith
of Life should poke me deep into His fires
and fling me on His anvil and make me over!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been worrying about my Dinkie. It&#8217;s all so
trivial, in a way, and yet I can&#8217;t persuade myself it
isn&#8217;t also tragic. He told Susie, before she left, that
he was quite willing to go to bed a little earlier one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span>
night, because then &#8220;he could dream about Doreen.&#8221;
And I noticed, not long ago, that instead of taking
just <i>one</i> of our Newton Pippins to school with him,
he had formed the habit of taking <i>two</i>. On making
investigation, I discovered that this second apple
ultimately and invariably found its way into the
hands of Mistress Doreen O&#8217;Lone. And last week
Dinkie autocratically commanded Whinstane Sandy
to hitch Mudski up in the old cutter, to go sleigh-riding
with the lady of his favor to the Teetzels&#8217;
taffy-pull. Dinkie&#8217;s mother was not consulted in the
matter&mdash;and that is the disturbing feature of it all.
I can&#8217;t help remembering what Duncan once said
about my boy growing out of my reach. If I ever
lost my Dinkie I would indeed be alone, terribly and
hopelessly alone.</p>

<h2><i>Wednesday the Eighth</i></h2>
</div>
<p>Dinkie, who has been disturbing me the last few
days by going about with an air of suppressed excitement,
brought my anxiety to a head yesterday by
staring into my face and then saying:</p>
<p>&#8220;Mummy, I&#8217;ve got a secret!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What secret?&#8221; I asked, doing my best to appear
indifferent.</p>
<p>But Dinkie was not to be trapped.</p>
<p>&#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t be a secret, if I told you,&#8221; he
sagaciously explained.</p>
<p>I studied my child with what was supposed to be
a reproving eye.</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean you can&#8217;t even tell your own Mummy?&#8221;
I demanded.</p>
<p>He shook his head, in solemn negation.</p>
<p>&#8220;But can you, some day?&#8221; I pursued.</p>
<p>He thought this over.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, some day,&#8221; he acknowledged, squeezing my
knee.</p>
<p>&#8220;How long will I have to wait?&#8221; I asked, wondering
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span>
what could bring such a rhapsodic light into his
hazel-specked eye. I thought, of course, of Doreen
O&#8217;Lone. And I wished the O&#8217;Lones would follow in
the footsteps of so many other successful ranchers
and trek off to California. Then, as I sat studying
Dinkie, I countermanded that wish. For its fulfillment
would bring loneliness to the heart of my laddie&mdash;and
loneliness is hell! So, instead, I struggled as
best I could to banish all thought of the matter from
my mind. But it was only half a success. I remembered
that Gershom himself had been going about as
abstracted as an ant-eater and as gloomy as a crow,
during the last week; and I kept sniffing something
unpropitious up-wind. I even hoped that Dinkie
would return to the subject, as children with a secret
have the habit of doing. But he has been as tight-lipped
on the matter as his reticent old dad might
have been.</p>

<h2><i>Wednesday the Fifteenth</i></h2>
</div>
<p>I got an altogether unlooked-for Valentine yesterday.
It was a brief but a significant letter from
Dinky-Dunk, telling me that he had &#8220;taken over&#8221; the
Goodhue house in Mount Royal and asking me if I
intended to be its mistress. He has bought the house,
apparently, completely furnished and is getting
ready to move into it the first week in March.</p>
<p>The whole thing has rather taken my breath away.
I don&#8217;t object to an ultimatum, but I do dislike to
have it come like a bolt from the blue. I have arrived
at my Rubicon, all right, and about everything that&#8217;s
left of my life, I suppose, will hang on my decision. I
don&#8217;t know whether to laugh or to cry, to be horrified
or hilarious. At one moment I have a tendency to
emulate Marguerite doing the Jewel-Song in <i>Faust</i>.
&#8220;This isn&#8217;t <i>me</i>! This isn&#8217;t <i>me</i>!&#8221; I keep protesting to
myself. But Marguerite, I know, would never be
so ungrammatical. And then I begin to foresee difficulties.
The mere thought of leaving Casa Grande
tears my heart. When we go away, as that wise man
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span>
of Paris once said, we die a little. This will always
seem my home. I could never forsake it utterly. I
dread to forsake it for even a portion of each year.
I am a part of the prairie, now, and I could never
be entirely happy away from it. And to accept that
challenge&mdash;for however one may look at it, it remains
a challenge&mdash;and go to the new home in Calgary
would surely be another concession. And I have been
conceding, conceding, for the sake of my children.
How much more can I concede?</p>
<p>Yet, when all is said and done, I am one of a family.
I am not a free agent. I am chained to the oar
for life. When we link up with the race we have more
than the little ring of our own Ego to remember. It
is not, as Dinky-Dunk once pointed out to me, a good
thing to get &#8220;Indianized.&#8221; We have our community
obligations and they must be faced. The children,
undoubtedly, would have advantages in the city. And
to find my family reunited would be &#8220;<i>le d&eacute;sir de
para&icirc;tre</i>.&#8221; But I can&#8217;t help remembering how much
there is to remember. I&#8217;m humbler now, it&#8217;s true,
than I once was. I no longer say &#8220;One side, please!&#8221;
to life, while life, like old Major Elmes on Murray
Hill, declines to vary its course for one small and
piping voice. Instead of getting gangway, I find,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span>
I&#8217;m apt to get an obliterating thump on the spine.
Heaven knows, I want to do the right thing. But
the issue seems so hopelessly tangled. I have brooded
over it and I have even prayed over it. But it all
seems to come to nothing. I sometimes nurse a
ghostly sort of hope that it may be taken out of my
hands, that some power outside myself may intervene
to decide. For it impresses me as ominous that I
should be able to hesitate at such a time, when a
woman, for once in her life, should know her own
mind, should see her own fixed goal and fight her way
to it. I&#8217;ve been wondering if I haven&#8217;t ebbed away
into that half-warm impersonality which used to impress
me as the last stage in moral decay.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;m not the fishy type of woman. I know I&#8217;m
not. And I&#8217;m not a hard-head. I&#8217;ve always had a
horror of being hard, for fear my hardness might in
some way be passed on to my Dinkie. I want to keep
my boy kindly and considerate of others, and loyal
to the people who love him. But I balk at that word
&#8220;loyal.&#8221; For if I expect loyalty in my offspring I
surely must have it myself. And I stood up before a
minister of God, not so many years ago, and took an
oath to prove loyal to my husband, to cleave to him
in sickness and in health. I also took an oath to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span>
honor him. But he has made that part of the compact
almost impossible. And my children, if I go
back to him, will come under his influence. And I
can&#8217;t help questioning what that influence will be.
I have only one life to live. And I have a human
anxiety to get out of it all that is coming to me. I
even feel that it owes me something, that there are
certain arrears of happiness to be made up.... I
wish I had a woman, older and wiser than myself, to
talk things over with. I have had the impulse to
write to Peter, and tell him everything, and ask him
what I ought to do. But that doesn&#8217;t impress me as
being quite fair to Peter. And, oddly enough, it
doesn&#8217;t impress me as being quite fair to Dinky-Dunk.
So I&#8217;m going to wait a week or two and let
the cream of conviction rise on the pan of indecision.
There&#8217;s a tiny parliament of angels, in the inner
chambers of our heart, who talk these things over and
decide them while we sleep.</p>

<p>We had to dig in, like bears, for two whole days
while the first real snow-storm of the winter raged
outside. But the skies have cleared, the wind has
gone, and the weather is crystal-clear again. Dinkie
and Poppsy, furred to the ears, are out on the drifts
learning to use the snow-shoes which Percy and Olga
sent down to them for Christmas. Dinkie has made
himself a spear by lashing his broken-bladed jack-knife
to the handle of my headless dutch-hoe and has
converted himself into a stealthy Iluit stalking a
polar bear in the form of poor old Scotty, who can&#8217;t
quite understand why he is being driven so relentlessly
from crevice to Arctic crevice. They have also
built an igloo, and indulged in what is apparently
marriage by capture, with the reluctant bride making
her repeated escape by floundering over drifts piled
even higher than the fence-tops. It makes me hanker
to get my own snow-shoes on my moccasined feet
again and go trafficking over that undulating white
world of snow, where barb-wire means no more than
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span>
a line-fence in Noah&#8217;s Flood. No one could remain
morose, in weather like this. You must dress for it,
of course, since that arching blue sky has sword-blades
of cold sheathed in its velvety soft azure. But
it goes to your head, like wine, and you wonder what
makes you feel that life is so well worth living.</p>

</div>
<p>The armistice continues. And I continue to sit on
my keg of powder and sing &#8220;<i>O Sole Mio</i>&#8221; to the
northern moon.</p>
<p>I have had Whinstane Sandy build a toboggan-slide
out of the old binder-shed, which has been pretty
well blown to pieces by last summer&#8217;s wind-storms.
He picked out the soundest of the two-by-fours and
made a framework which he boarded over with the
best of the weather-bleached old siding. For when
you haven&#8217;t the luxury of a hill on your landscape,
you can at least make an imitation one. Whinnie
even planed the board-joints in the center of the runway
and counter-sunk every nail-head&mdash;and cussed
volubly when he pounded his heavily mittened thumb
with the hammer. The finished structure could hardly
be called a thing of beauty. We have only one of the
stable-ladders to mount it from the rear, and instead
of toboggans we have only Poppsy&#8217;s home-made
hand-sleigh and Dinkie&#8217;s somewhat dilapidated &#8220;flexible
coaster.&#8221; But when water had been carried out
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span>
to that smooth runway and the boards had been
coated with ice, like brazil-nuts <i>glac&eacute;</i>, and the snow
along the lower course had been well packed down, it
at least gave you a run for your money.</p>
<p>The tip-top point of the slide couldn&#8217;t have been
much more than fourteen or fifteen feet above the
prairie-floor, but it seemed perilous enough when I
tried it out&mdash;much to the perturbation of Whinstane
Sandy&mdash;by lying stomach-down on Dinkie&#8217;s coaster
and letting myself shoot along that well-iced incline.
It was a kingly sensation, that of speed wedded to
danger, and it took me back to Davos at a breath.
Then I tried it with Dinkie, and then with Poppsy,
and then with Poppsy and Dinkie together. We had
some grand old tumbles, in the loose snow, and some
unmentionable bruises, before we became sufficiently
expert to tool our sleigh-runners along their proper
trail. But it was good fun. The excitement of the
thing, in fact, rather got into my blood. In half an
hour the three of us were covered with snow, were
shouting like Comanches, and were having an altogether
wild time of it. There was climbing enough
to keep us warm, for all the sub-zero weather, and I
was finally allowed to escape to the house only on the
promise that I risk my neck again on the morrow.</p>

</div>
<p>My Dinkie&#8217;s secret is no longer a secret. It
divulged itself to me to-day with the suddenness of
a thunder-clap. <i>Peter Ketley has been back at
Alabama Ranch for nearly three weeks.</i></p>
<p>I was out with the kiddies this afternoon, having
another wild time on the toboggan-slide, dressed in an
old Mackinaw of Dinky-Dunk&#8217;s buckled in close
around my waist and a pair of Whinnie&#8217;s heaviest
woolen socks over my moccasins and a mangy old
gray-squirrel cap on by head. The children looked
like cherubs who&#8217;d been rolled in a flour-barrel, with
their eyes shining and their cheeks glowing like Richmond
roses, but I must have looked like something
that had been put out to frighten the coyotes away.
At any rate, there we were, all squealing like pigs and
all powdered from tip to toe with the dry snow and
all looking like Piutes on the war-path. And who
should walk calmly about the corner of the buildings
but Peter himself!</p>
<p>My heart stopped beating and I had to lean
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span>
against the end of the toboggan-slide until I could
catch my breath.</p>
<p>He called out, &#8220;Hello, youngsters!&#8221; as quietly as
though he had seen us all the day before. I said
&#8220;Peter!&#8221; in a strangled sort of whisper, and wondered
what made my knees wabble as I stood staring
at him as though he had been a ghost.</p>
<p>But Peter was no ghost. He was there before me,
in the body, still smoking his foolish little pipe, wearing
the familiar old coonskin cap and coat that
looked as though the moths had made many a Roman
holiday of their generously deforested pelt. He took
the pipe out of his mouth as he stepped over to me,
and pulled off his heavy old gauntlet before he shook
hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;Peter!&#8221; I repeated in my ridiculous small whisper.</p>
<p>He didn&#8217;t speak. But he smiled, a bit wistfully,
as he stared down at me. And for just a moment, I
think, an odd look of longing came into his searching
honest eyes which studied my face as though he were
counting every freckle and line and eyelash there.
He continued to X-ray me with that hungry stare of
his until I took my hand away and could feel the
blood surging back to my face.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a long time,&#8221; he said as he puffed hard on his
pipe, apparently to keep it from going out. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span>
sound of his voice sent a little thrill through my
body. I felt as rattle-headed as a rabbit, and was
glad when Dinkie and Poppsy captured him by each
knee and hung on like catamounts.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where did you come from?&#8221; I finally asked, trying
in vain to be as collected as Peter himself.</p>
<p>Then he told me. He told me as nonchalantly as
though he were giving me a piece of news of no particular
interest. He had rather a difficult book to
finish up, and he concluded the quietness of Alabama
Ranch would suit him to a T. And when spring came
he wanted to have a look about for a nest of the
whooping crane. It has been rather a rarity, for
some sixteen or seventeen years, this whooping crane,
and the American Museum was offering a mighty
handsome prize for a specimen. Then he was compelled
to give his attention to Dinkie and Poppsy,
and tried the slide a couple of times, and announced
that our coaster was better than the chariot of
Icarius. And by this time I had recovered my wits
and my composure and got some of the snow off my
Mackinaw.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have I changed?&#8221; I asked Peter as he turned to
study my face for the second time.</p>
<p>&#8220;To me,&#8221; he said as he brushed the snow from his
gauntlets, &#8220;you are always adorable!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span></p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Verboten!</i>&#8221; I retorted to that, wondering why
anything so foolish could have the power to make my
pulses sing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; he asked, as his eyes met mine.</p>
<p>&#8220;For the same old reason,&#8221; I told him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Reasons,&#8221; he said, &#8220;are like shoes: Time has the
trick of wearing them out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When that happens, we have to get new ones,&#8221; I
reminded him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then what is the new one?&#8221; he asked, with an
unexpectedly solemn look on his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;My husband has just asked me to join him in
Calgary,&#8221; I said, releasing my bolt.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you going to?&#8221; he asked, with his face a mask.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I am,&#8221; I told him. For I could see, now,
how Peter&#8217;s return had simplified the situation by
complicating it. Already he had made my course
plainer to me. I could foresee what this new factor
would imply. I could understand what Peter&#8217;s presence
at Alabama Ranch would come to mean. And
I had to shut my eyes to the prospect. I was still
the same old single-track woman with a clear-cut duty
laid out before her. There were certain luxuries, for
the sake of my own soul&#8217;s peace, I could never afford.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why are you going back to your husband?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span>
Peter was asking, with real perplexity on his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because he needs me,&#8221; I said as I stood watching
the children go racing down the slide.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; he asked, with what impressed me as his
first touch of harshness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Must I explain?&#8221; I inquired with my own first
movement in self-defense, for it had suddenly occurred
to me that any such explaining would be much
more difficult than I dreamed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course not,&#8221; said Peter, changing color a
little. &#8220;It&#8217;s only that I&#8217;m so tremendously anxious
to&mdash;to understand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To understand what?&#8221; I questioned, both hoping
and dreading that he would go on to the bitter end.</p>
<p>&#8220;That <i>you</i> understand,&#8221; was his cryptic retort.
And for once in his life Peter disappointed me.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t afford to,&#8221; I said with an effort at lightness
which seemed to hurt him more than it ought.
Then I realized, as I stood looking up into his face,
that I was doing little to merit that humble and magnificent
loyalty of Peter&#8217;s. <i>He</i> would play fair to
the end. He was too big of heart to think first of
himself. It was <i>me</i> he was thinking of; it was <i>me</i> he
wanted to see happy. But I had my own road to go,
and no outsider could guide me.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s no use, Peter,&#8221; I said as I put my mittened
hand on his gauntleted arm without quite knowing
I was doing it. And I went on to warn him that he
must not confront me with kindness, that I was a
good deal like an Indian&#8217;s dog which neither looks for
kindness nor understands it. He laughed a trifle
bitterly at that and reminded me, as he stood staring
at me, of a Pribilof seal staring into an Arctic sun.
Then he said an odd thing. &#8220;I wish I could make it
a bit easier for you,&#8221; he remarked as impersonally as
though he were meditating aloud.</p>
<p>I asked him why he said that. He evasively explained
that he thought it was because I had what the
Romans called <i>constantia</i>. So I asked him to explain
<i>constantia</i>. And he said, with a shrug, that we might
regard it as firm consideration of a question before
acting on it. I explained, at that, that it wasn&#8217;t a
matter of choice, but of character. He was willing
to acknowledge that I was right. But before that
altogether unsatisfactory little debate was over Peter
made me promise him one thing. He has made me
promise that before I leave we have a tramp over the
prairie together. And we have agreed that Sunday
would be as good a day as any.</p>

<h2><i>Saturday the Twenty-Fifth</i></h2>
</div>
<p>I have sent word to Duncan to expect me in Calgary
as soon as I can get things ready. My decision
is made. And it is final. Two ghostly hands have
reached out and turned me toward my husband. One
is the Past. The other is the Proprieties. If life
out here were a little more like the diamond-dyed
Westerns, Peter Ketley and Duncan McKail would
fight with hammerless Colts, the victor would throw
me over the horn of his saddle, and vanish in a cloud
of dust, while Struthers was turning Casa Grande
into a faro-hall and my two kiddies were busy holding
up the Elk Crossing stage-coach.</p>
<p>But life, alas, isn&#8217;t so dramatic as we dream it. It
cross-hobbles us and hog-ties us and leaves us afraid
of our own wilted impulses. I have a terror of failure.
And it&#8217;s plain enough I have only one mission
on God&#8217;s green footstool. I&#8217;m a home-maker, and
nothing more. I&#8217;m a home-maker confronted by the
last chance to make good at my one and only calling.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span>
And whatever it costs, I&#8217;m going to make my
husband recognize me as a patient and long-suffering
Penelope....</p>
<p>But enough of the rue! To-morrow I&#8217;m going
snow-shoeing with Peter. I&#8217;m praying that the
weather will be propitious. I want one of our sparkling-burgundy
days with the sun shining bright and
a nip in the air like a stiletto buried in rose leaves.
For it may be the last time in all my life I shall walk
on the prairie with my friend, Peter Ketley. The
page is going to be turned over, the candle snuffed
out, and the singing birds of my freedom silenced.
I have met my Rubicon, and it must be crossed. But
last night, for the first time in a month, I plastered
enough cold cream on my nose to make me look like a
buttered muffin, and rubbed enough almond-oil meal
on my arms to make them look like a miller&#8217;s. And
I&#8217;ve been asking myself if I&#8217;m the sedate old lady life
has been trying to make me. There are certain
Pacific Islands, Gershom tells me, where the climate
is so stable that the matter of weather is never even
mentioned, where the people who bathe in that eternal
calm are never conscious of the conditions surrounding
them. That&#8217;s the penalty, I suppose, that humanity
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span>
pays for constancy. There are no lapses to record,
no deviations to be accounted for, no tempests to
send us tingling into the shelters of wonder. And I
can&#8217;t yet be quite sure whether this rebellious old
heart of mine wants to be a Pacific Islander or not.</p>

<h2><i>Monday the Twenty-Seventh</i></h2>
</div>
<p>Peter and I have had our tramp in the snow. It
wasn&#8217;t a sunny day, as I had hoped. It was one of
those intensely cold northern days without wind or
sun, one of those misted days which Balzac somewhere
describes as a beautiful woman born blind. It was
fifty-three below zero when we left the house, with the
smoke going up in the gray air as straight and undisturbed
as a pine-tree and the drifts crunching like
dry charcoal under our snow-shoes. We were woolened
and mittened and capped and furred up to the
eyes, however, and I was warmer than I&#8217;ve been many
a time on Boston Common in March, even though
we did look like a couple of deep-sea divers and
steamed like fire-engines when we breathed.</p>
<p>We tramped until we were tired, swung back to
Casa Grande, and Peter came in for a cup of tea
and then trudged off to Alabama Ranch again. And
that was the lee and the long of it, as the Irish say.
What did we talk about? Heaven knows what we
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span>
didn&#8217;t talk about! Peter told me about a rancher
named Bidwell, north of The Crossing, being found
frozen to death in a snow-drift, frozen stiff, with the
horse still standing and the rider still sitting upright
in the saddle. He said there was a lot of rot talked
about the great clean outdoors. The sentimentalists
found that they naturally felt a bit niftier in fresh
air, but the great outdoors, according to Peter, is an
arena of endless murder and rapine and warfare, and
the cleanest acre of forest or prairie under the sun
somewhere has its stains of blood and its record of
cruelty. We talked about Susie and the negative
phrasing of the ten moral laws and the Horned Dinosaur
from Sand Hill Creek (whose bones Peter reckoned
to be at least three million years old) and the
marriage customs of the Innuits. And we talked
about Matzenauer and Kreisler and the best cure for
chilblains and about Gershom and Poppsy and
Dinkie&mdash;but most of all about Dinkie.</p>
<p>Peter asked me if I&#8217;d seen Dinkie&#8217;s school essays
on <i>The Flag</i> and <i>The Capture of Quebec</i>, and rather
surprised me by handing over crumpled copies of the
same, Dinkie having proudly despatched these masterpieces
all the way to Philadelphia for his &#8220;Uncle
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span>
Peter&#8217;s&#8221; approval. It hurt me, for just one foolish
fraction of a second, to think my boy had confidences
with an outsider which he could not have with his own
mother. And then I remembered that Peter wasn&#8217;t
an outsider. I realized how much he had brought
into my laddie&#8217;s life, how much, in a different way, he
had brought into my own. I even tried to tell him
about this. But he stopped me short by saying
something in Latin which he later explained meant
&#8220;by taking the middle course we shall not go amiss.&#8221;
So I came back to Casa Grande, not exactly with a
feeling of frustration, but with a feeling of possibilities
withheld and issues deferred. It was a companionable
enough tramp, I suppose. But I&#8217;m afraid
I was a disappointment to Peter. His gaiety impressed
me as a bit forced. I am slightly mystified
by his refusal, while taking serious things seriously,
to take anything tragically. Even at tea, with all
its air of the valedictory hanging over us, he was
nice and gay, like the Christmas beeves the city
butchers stick paper rosettes into, or the circus-band
playing like mad while the tumbler who has had a
fall is being carried out to the dressing-tent. Peter
even offhandedly inquired, as he was going, if he
might have Scotty to take care of, provided it was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span>
not expedient to take Dinkie&#8217;s dog along to Calgary
with us.... I&#8217;m not quite certain&mdash;I may be wrong,
but there are moments, odd earthquakey moments,
when I have a suspicion that Peter will be keeping
more than Scotty after we&#8217;ve trekked off to Calgary!</p>

<h2><i>Saturday the Fourth</i></h2>
</div>
<p>This tearing up of roots is a much sorrier business
than I had imagined. And more difficult. I
find it hard to know what to take and what to leave
behind. And there is so much to be thought of, so
much to be arranged for, so much to be done. I have
had to write Duncan and tell him I&#8217;ll be a few days
later than I intended. My biggest problem has been
with Whinstane Sandy and Struthers. I called them
in and had a talk with them and told them I wanted
them to keep Casa Grande going the same as ever.
Then I made myself into the god from the machine
by calmly announcing the only way things could be
arranged would be for the two of them to get married.</p>
<p>Struthers, at this suggestion, promptly became as
coy as a partridge-hen. Whinnie, of course, remained
Scottish and canny. He became more shrewdly magnanimous,
however, after we&#8217;d had a bit of talk by
ourselves. &#8220;Weel, I&#8217;ll tak&#8217; the woman, rather than
see her frettin&#8217; hersel&#8217; to death!&#8221; he finally conceded,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span>
knowing only too well he&#8217;d nest warm and live
well for the rest of his days. He&#8217;d been hoping, he
confessed to me, that some day he&#8217;d get back to that
claim of his up in the Klondike. But he wasn&#8217;t
so young as he once was. And perhaps Dinkie, when
he was grown to a man, could go up and look after
his rights. &#8217;Twould be a grand journey, he averred
with a sigh, for a high-spirited lad turned twenty.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be stayin&#8217; with Pee-Wee and the old place
here,&#8221; concluded Whinstane Sandy, giving me his
rough old hand as a pledge. And with tears in my
eyes I lifted that faithful old hand up to my lips and
kissed it. Whinnie, I knew, would die for me. But
he would pass away before he&#8217;d be willing to put his
loyalty and his courage and his kind-heartedness into
pretty speeches. Struthers, on the other hand, has
become too flighty to be of much use to me in my
packing. She has plunged headlong into a riot of
baking, has sent for a fresh supply of sage tea, and
is secretly perusing a dog-eared volume which I have
reason to know is <i>The Marriage Guide</i>.</p>
<p>Gershom, all things considered, is the most dolorous
member of our home circle. He says little, but
inspects me with the wounded eyes of a neglected
spaniel. He will stay on at Casa Grande until the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span>
Easter holidays, and then migrate to the Teetzels&#8217;.
As for Dinkie and Poppsy, they are too young to
understand. The thought of change excites them,
but they have no idea of what they are leaving behind.</p>
<p>Last night, when I was dog-tired after my long
day&#8217;s work, I remembered about Dinkie&#8217;s school-essays
and took them out to read. And having done
so, I realized there was something sacred about them.
They gave me a glimpse of a groping young soul
reaching up toward the light.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a Flag,&#8221; I read, &#8220;to thrill our bones
and be prod of and no man boy woman or girl&#8221; (and
the not altogether artless <i>diminuendo</i> did not escape
me!) &#8220;should never let it drag in the dust. It flotes
at the bow of our ships and waves from the top of
most post offices etc. And now we have a flag and a
flag staf in front of our school and on holdays and
when every grate man dies we put said flag up at haf
mast.... It is the flag of the rich and the poor, the
flag of our country which all of whose citizens have
a right to fly, the hig&#8221; (obviously meant for <i>high</i>)
&#8220;and the low, the rich and the poor. And we must
not only keep our flag but blazen it still further with
deeds nobely done. If ever you have to shed your
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span>
blood for your country remeber its for the nobelest
flag that flies the same being an emblen of our native
land to which it represens and stands in high esteem
by the whole people of a country.&#8221; ... God bless
his patriotic little bones! My bairn knew what he
was trying to get at, but it&#8217;s plain he didn&#8217;t quite
know how to get there.</p>
<p>But the drama of the Capture of Quebec plainly
put him on easier ground. For here was a story
worth the telling. And what could be more glorious
than the death of Wolfe as I see it through my little
Dinkie&#8217;s eyes?</p>
<p>For I read: &#8220;The french said Wolfe&#8221; (<i>can</i> has first
been written and then scratched out and <i>would</i> substituted)
&#8220;never get up that rivver but Wolfe fooled
them with a trick by running the french flag up on
his shipps so the french pilots without fear padled
out and come abord when Wolfe took them prissoners
and made them pilot the english ships safe to the
iland of Orlens. He wanted to capsture the city of
Quebec without distroiting it. But the clifs were to
high and the brave Montcalm dified Wolfe who lost
400 men and got word Amherst could not come and
so himself took sick and went to bed. But a desserter
from the french gave Wolfe the pass word and when
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span>
his ships crept further up the rivver in the dark a
french senntry called out qui vive and one of Wolfe&#8217;s
men who spoke french well ansered la france and the
senntry said to himself they was french ships and let
them go on. Next day Wolfe was better and saw a
goat clime up the clifs near the plains of Abraham
and said where a goat could go he could go to. So
he forgot being sick and desided to clime up Wolfe&#8217;s
cove which was not then called that until later. It
was a dark night and they went in row boats with all
the oars mufled. It was a formadible sight that
would have made even bolder men shrink with fear.
But it was the brave Higlanders who lead with their
muskits straped to their sholdiers climing up the
steep rock by grabbing at roots of trees and shrubbs
and not a word was wispered but the french senntrys
saw the tree moving and asked qui vive again. The
same sholdier who once studdied hard and lernt
french said la france as he had done before and they
got safe to the top and faced the city. At brake of
day they stood face to face, french and english. But
Montcalm marched out to cut them off there and
Wolfe lined his men up in a line and said hold your
fire until they are within forty paces away from us.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span>
The french caused many causilties but the english
never wavered. Montcalm still on horse back reseaved
a mortal wound, he would of fell off if two of his tall
granadeers hadn&#8217;t held him up and Wolfe too was
shot on the wirst but went right on. Again he was
shot this time more fataly and as they were laying
him down one of the men exclaimed See how they run.
Who run murmurred the dieing Wolfe. The enemy
sir replied the man. Then I die happy said Generral
Wolfe and with a great sigh rolled over on his side
and died.... And when the doctor told Montcalm
he could only live a few hours he said God be prased I
shall not live to see Quebec fall. Brave words like
those should not be forgoten and what Wolfe said
was just as brave. No more fiting words could be
said by anybody than those he said in the boats with
the mufled oars that night that the paths of glory
leed but to the grave.&#8221; ...</p>
<p>I have folded up the carefully written pages,
reverently, remembering my promise to return them
to Peter. But for a while at least I shall keep them
with me. They have set me thinking, reminding me
how time flies. Here is my little boy, grown into an
historian, sagely philosophizing over the tragedies of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span>
life. My wee laddie, expressing himself through the
recorded word.... It seems such a short time ago
that he was taking his first stumbling steps along the
dim hallways of language. I have been turning back
to the journal I began shortly after his birth and kept
up for so long, the na&iuml;ve journal of a young mother
registering her wonder at the unfolding mysteries of
life. It became less minute and less meticulous, I
notice, as the years slipped past, and after the advent
of Poppsy and Pee-Wee the entries seem a bit hurried
and often incoherent. But I have dutifully noted
how my Dinkie first said &#8220;Ah goom&#8221; for &#8220;All gone,&#8221;
just as I have fondly remarked his persistent use of
the reiterative intensive, with careful citations of his
&#8220;da-da&#8221; and his &#8220;choo-choo car,&#8221; and a &#8220;bow-wow&#8221;
as applied to any living animal, and &#8220;wa-wa&#8221; for
water, and &#8220;me-me&#8221; for milk, and &#8220;din-din&#8221; for dinner,
and going &#8220;bye-bye&#8221; for going to sleep on his
little &#8220;tum-tum.&#8221; I even solemnly ask, forgetting my
Max M&uuml;ller, what lies at the root of this strange
reduplicative process. Then I come to where I have
set down for future generations the momentous fact
that my Dinkie first said &#8220;let&#8217;s playtend&#8221; for &#8220;let&#8217;s
pretend,&#8221; and spoke of &#8220;nasturtiums&#8221; as &#8220;excursions,&#8221;
and announced that he could bark loud
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span>
enough to make Baby Poppsy&#8217;s eyes &#8220;bug out&#8221;
instead of &#8220;bulge out.&#8221; And I come again to where
I have affectionately registered the fact that my son
says &#8220;set-sun&#8221; for &#8220;sunset&#8221; and speaks of his
&#8220;rumpers&#8221; instead of his &#8220;rompers,&#8221; and coins the
very appropriate word &#8220;downer&#8221; to go with its sister
word of &#8220;upper&#8221; and describes his Mummy as
&#8220;<i>wearing</i> Daddy&#8217;s coffee-cup&#8221; when he really meant
<i>using</i> Daddy&#8217;s coffee-cup.</p>
<p>It all seems very fond and foolish now, just as at
one time it all seemed very big and wonderful. And
I remember schooling my Poppsy to say &#8220;Daddy&#8217;s all
sweet&#8221; and how her little tongue, stumbling over the
sibilant, converted it into the non-complimentary
&#8220;Daddy&#8217;s all feet,&#8221; which my Dinky-Dunk so scowlingly
resented. And I have even compiled a list of
Dinkie&#8217;s earliest &#8220;howlers,&#8221; from the time he was
first interested in Adam and Eve and asked to be
told about &#8220;The Garden of Sweden&#8221; until he later
explained one of Poppsy&#8217;s crying-spells by announcing
she had dug a hole out by the corral and
wanted to bring it into the house. I used to smile a
bit skeptically over these tongue-twists of children,
but now I know they are re-born with each new generation,
the same old turns of thought and the same
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span>
old kinks of utterance. I don&#8217;t know why, but there
is even a touch of sadness about the old jokes now.
The patina of time gathers upon them and mellows
them and makes me realize they belong to the past&mdash;the
past with its pain and its joy, that can never
come back to mortal mothers again.</p>

<h2><i>Monday the Thirtieth</i></h2>
</div>
<p>&#8220;We die a little, when we go away.&#8221; How true it
is! By to-morrow we will be gone. My heart is
heavy as lead. I go about, doing things for the last
time, looking at things for the last time, and pretending
to be as matter-of-fact as a tripper breaking
camp. But there&#8217;s a laryngitis lump in my throat
and there are times when I&#8217;m glad I&#8217;m almost too
busy to think.</p>
<p>I was hoping that the weather would be bad, as it
ought to at this time of the year, so that I might
leave my prairie with some lessened pang of regret.
But the last two days have been miraculously mild.
A Chinook has been blowing, the sky has been a palpitating
soft dome of azure, and a winey smell of
spring has crept over the earth.... To-night,
knowing it was the last night, I crept out to say
good-by to my little Pee-Wee asleep in his lonely
little bed. It was a perfect night. The Lights were
playing low in the north, weaving together in a
tangle of green and ruby and amethyst. The prairie
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span>
was very still. The moonlight lay on everything,
thick and golden and soft with mystery. I knelt
beside Pee-Wee&#8217;s grave, not in bitterness, but bathed
in peace. I knelt there and prayed.</p>
<p>It frightened me a little, when I looked up, to see
Peter standing beside the little white fence. I
thought, at first, that he was a ghost, he stood so
still and he seemed so tall in the moonlight.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll watch your boy,&#8221; he said very quietly, &#8220;until
you come back.&#8221;</p>
<p>He made me think of the Old Priest in <i>The Sorrowful
Inheritance</i>. He seemed so calmly benignant, so
dependable, so safe in his simple other-worldliness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Peter!&#8221; was all I could say as I moved toward
him in the moonlight. He nodded, as much to himself
as to me, as he took my hand in his. I felt a
great ache, which was not really an ache, and a new
kind of longing which never before, in all my life, I
had nursed or known. I must have moved closer to
Peter, though I could feel his hand pull itself away
from mine. It made me feel terribly alone in the
world.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you going to kiss me good-by?&#8221; I cried
out, with my hand on his shoulder.</p>
<p>Peter shook his head from side to side, very slowly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span></p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Verboten!</i>&#8221; he said as he put his hand over the
hand which I had put on his shoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I may never come back. Peter!&#8221; I whispered,
feeling the tears go slowly down my wet cheek.</p>
<p>Peter took my unsteady fingers and placed them on
the white pickets of the little rectangular fence.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll come back,&#8221; he said very quietly. And
when I looked up he had turned away.</p>
<p>I could see him walking off in the yellow moonlight
with his shoulders back and his head up. He walked
slowly, with an odd wading movement, like a man
walking through water. I was tempted, for a
moment, to call after him. But some power that was
not of me or any part of me prompted me to silence.
I stood watching him until he seemed a moving
shadow along the level floor of the world flooded with
primrose-yellow, until he became a shifting stroke of
umber on a background of misty gold. I stood looking
after him as he passed away, out of my sight, and
far, far off to the north a coyote howled and over
Casa Grande I could see a thin pennon of chimney-smoke
going up toward Arcturus.... Good-by,
Peter, and God bless you....</p>
<p>Unlimited, indeed, is the power of Eros. For when
I went to slip quietly into the house, I found Whinnie
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span>
and Struthers seated together beside the kitchen
range. And Struthers was reading <i>Tam O&#8217;Shanter</i>
aloud to her laird.</p>
<p>&#8220;Read slow, noo, lassie, an&#8217; tak&#8217; it a&#8217; in,&#8221; said the
placidly triumphant voice of Whinstane Sandy, &#8220;for
it&#8217;ll be lang before ye ken its like!&#8221;</p>

<h2><i>Thursday the Seventeenth</i></h2>
</div>
<p>The migration has been effected ... I am alone
in my room, I have two and three-quarters trunks
unpacked, and I feel like a President&#8217;s wife the night
after Inauguration. It is well past midnight, but I
am too tired and too unsettled to sleep. Things turn
out so differently to what one expects! And all
change, to the home-staying heart, can be so abysmally
upsetting!...</p>
<p>We were a somewhat disheveled and intimidated flock
when we emerged from our train and found Duncan
awaiting us with an amazingly big touring-car which,
as he explained with a short laugh at my gape of
wonder, the Barcona Mines would pay for in a week.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s no piker you&#8217;re pulling with now,&#8221; he exclaimed
as we climbed stiff and awkward into that
deep-upholstered grandeur on wheels. He said that
the children had grown but would have to be togged
out with some new duds&mdash;little knowing how I had
stayed up until long past midnight mending and
pressing and doing my best to make my bucolic offspring
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span>
presentable. And he told me it was <i>some</i> city
I had come to, as I&#8217;d very soon see for myself. And
it was <i>some</i> shack he&#8217;d corralled for his family, he
added with a chuckle of pride.</p>
<p>I tried to be interested in the skyscrapers he
showed me along Eighth Avenue, and the Palliser,
and the concreted subway, and the Rockies, in the
distance, with the wine-glow on their snow-clad peaks.
And while I did my best to shake off the Maud-Muller
feeling which was creeping over me, by studying the
tranquillizingly remote mountain-tops, Duncan confided
to me that he had first said: &#8220;Fifty thousand
or bu&#8217;st!&#8221; But two months ago he had amended that
to &#8220;A hundred thousand or bu&#8217;st!&#8221; and now he had his
reasons for saying, with his jaw set: &#8220;Just a cool
quarter of a million, before I quit this game!&#8221;</p>
<p>It was for us, I told myself as I looked down at
my kiddies, that the Dour Man behind the big
mahogany wheel was fighting. This, I felt, should
bring me happiness, and a new sense of security.
And it was only because my stomach was empty, I
tried to assure myself, that my poor old prairie
heart felt that way. I should have been happy, for
I was going to a brand-new home&mdash;and it was one of
those foot-hill late afternoons that make you think of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span>
the same old razor-blade muffled up in the same old
panne-velvet, an evening of softness shot through
with a steely sharpness. There was a Chinook arch
of Irish point-lace still in the sky, very much like the
one I had left behind me, and the sky itself was a
canopy of robin-egg blue <i>cr&ecirc;pe de chine</i> hemmed with
salmon pink.</p>
<p>But as we whirled up out of the city into the higher
ground of some boulevarded and terraced residential
district the evening air seemed colder and the solemn
old Rockies toward the west took on an air of lonesomeness.
It made the thought of home and open
fires and quiet rooms very welcome. The lights came
out along the asphalted streets, spangling the slopes
of that sedate new suburb with rectangular lines of
brilliants. Duncan, in answer to the questions of the
children, explained that he was taking the longer way
round, so as to give us the best view of the house as
we drove in.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here we are!&#8221; he exulted as we slowed down and
turned into a crescent lined with baby poplar and
Manitoba maple.</p>
<p>I leaned out and saw a big new house of tapestry
brick, looking oddly palatial on its imposing slope of
rising ground. My husband stopped, in fact, midway
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span>
in a foolishly pillared gate that bisected a long
array of cobble-stone walls, so that we might get a
look at the gardens. They seemed very new gardens,
but much of their newness was lost in that mercifully
subduing light in which I saw trim-painted trellises
and sepulchral white flower-urns and pergolas not
yet softened with creepers. There was also a large
iron fountain, painted white, which Duncan apparently
liked very much, from the way he looked at it.
From two of the chimneys I could see smoke going
up in the quiet air. In the windows I could see lights,
rose-shaded and warm, and beyond the shrubbery
somewhere back in the garden a workman was driving
nails. His hammer fell and echoed like a series of
rifle-shots. From the garage chimney, too, came
smoke, and it was plain from the sounds that somebody
inside was busy tuning up a car-engine.</p>
<p>I sat staring at the grounds, at the cobble-stone
walls, at the tapestry-brick house with the high-shouldered
French cornices. It began to creep over
me how it meant service, how it meant protection,
how it meant guarded lives for me and mine, how it
stood an amazingly complicated piece of machinery
which took much thought to organize and much
money to maintain. And the mainspring behind it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span>
all, I remembered, was the man sitting at the mahogany
wheel so close to me. Light and warmth and
comfort and safety&mdash;they were all to come from the
conceiting and the struggling of my Dour Man,
fighting for an empty-headed family who were
scarcely worth it. He was, after all, the stoker down
in the hole, and without him everything would stop.
So when I saw that he was studying my face with
that intent sidelong glance of his, I reached over and
put my hand on his knee, as I had done so often, in
the old days.</p>
<p>He looked down, at that, with what was almost an
appearance of embarrassment.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to play my part,&#8221; I said with all the
earnestness of my earnest old heart, as he let in his
clutch and we started up the winding drive.</p>
<p>&#8220;It ought to be a considerable part,&#8221; he said as
we drew up under a bone-white porte-coch&egrave;re where
a small-bodied Jap stood respectfully impassive and
waiting to open the door for us.</p>
<p>My husband got down out of the car. I sat wondering
why I should feel so much like a Lady Jane
Grey approaching the headsman&#8217;s <i>makura</i>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on, kids!&#8221; Duncan called out with a parade
of joviality, like a cheer-leader who realized that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span>
things weren&#8217;t going just right. For Dinkie, I could
see, was shrinking back in the padded seat. His
underlip was trembling a trifle as he sat staring at
the strange new house. But Poppsy, true little
woman that she was, smiled appreciatively about at
the material grandeurs which confronted her. If
she&#8217;d had a tail, I&#8217;m sure, she&#8217;d have been wagging
it. And this so tickled her dad that he lifted her out
of the car and carried her bodily and triumphantly
up the steps.</p>
<p>I waited for Dinkie, whose eye met mine. I did my
best to show my teeth, that he might understand how
everything was eventually to be for the best. But his
face was still clouded as we climbed the steps and
passed under the yoke.</p>
<p>The little Jap, whose name, I have since found out,
is Tokudo, bowed a jack-knife bow and said
&#8220;<i>Irashai</i>&#8221; as I passed him. And &#8220;<i>Irashai</i>&#8221; I have
also discovered, is perfectly good Japanese for &#8220;Welcome.&#8221;</p>
<p>We had dinner at seven. It was a well-ordered
meal, but it went off rather dismally. I was depressed,
for reasons I couldn&#8217;t quite fathom, and the
children were tired, and Duncan, I&#8217;m afraid, was a
bit disappointed in us all. Tokudo had brought
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span>
cocktails for us, and Duncan, seeing I wasn&#8217;t drinking
mine, stowed both away in his honorable stomach.
He ate heartily, I noticed, and gave scant
appearance of a man pining away with a broken
heart. After dinner he sat back and bit off the end
of a cigar.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is my idea of living,&#8221; he proclaimed as he
sent a blue cloud up toward the rather awful dome-light
above the big table. &#8220;There&#8217;s stir and movement
here, all day long. Something more than sunsets
to look at! You&#8217;ll see&mdash;something to fill up your
day! Why, night seems to come before I even know
it. And before I&#8217;m out of bed I&#8217;m brooding over
what&#8217;s ahead of me for that particular date and day&mdash;Say,
that girl of ours is falling asleep in her chair
there!&#8221;</p>
<p>So I escaped and put the children to bed. And
while thus engaged I discovered that some of Duncan&#8217;s
new friends were dropping in on him. I wanted
to stay up-stairs, for my head was aching a lot and
my heart just a little, but Duncan called to me from
the bottom of the stairs. So down I went, like a
dutiful wife, to the room full of smoke and talk, where
two big men and one very thin woman in a baby-bear
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span>
motor coat were drinking Scotch highballs with my
lord and master. They were genial and jolly enough,
but I couldn&#8217;t understand their allusions and I
couldn&#8217;t see the points to their jokes. And they
seemed to stay an interminable length of time. I
was secretly uncomfortable, until they went, but I
became still more uncomfortable after they had gone.</p>
<p>For as we sat there together, in that oppressive
big room, I made rather an awful discovery. I found
that my husband and I had scarcely anything we
could talk about together. So I sat there, like an
alligator in a bayou, wondering why his rather
flushed face should be turned toward me every now
and then.</p>
<p>My heart beat a little faster as I saw him take out
his watch and wind it up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go to bed,&#8221; he said as he pushed it back in
his waistcoat pocket. My heart stopped beating
altogether, for a moment or two. I felt like a slave-girl
in a sheik&#8217;s tent, like a desert-woman just sold
into bondage.</p>
<p>It was the smoky air and the highballs, I suppose,
which left his eyes a little bloodshot as he turned
slowly about and studied my face. Then he repeated
what he had said before.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span></p>
<p>&#8220;<i>I can&#8217;t!</i>&#8221; I told him, with a foolish surge of
terror.</p>
<p>He sat quite a long time without speaking. I
could see the corners of the Holbein-Astronomer
mouth go down.</p>
<p>&#8220;As you say,&#8221; he finally remarked, with a grim
sort of quietness. But every bit of color had gone
from his face. I was glad when Tokudo came in to
take away the glasses.</p>
<p>Duncan stood up, after the servant had gone
again, and bowed to me very solemnly.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Oyasumi nasi</i>,&#8221; he said with a stabilizing ironic
smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;What does that mean?&#8221; I asked, doing my best to
smile back at him.</p>
<p>&#8220;That means &#8216;sleep well,&#8217;&#8221; explained my husband.
&#8220;But Tokudo would probably translate it into &#8216;Condescend
to enjoy honorable tranquillity.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>Instead of enjoying honorable tranquillity, however,
I am sitting up into the wee sma&#8217; hours of the
night, patrolling the gloomy ramparts of my soul&#8217;s
unrest.</p>

<h2><i>Wednesday the Twenty-Third</i></h2>
</div>
<p>This change to the city means a new life to my
children. But I can also see it means new dangers
and new influences. The simplicity of ranch life has
vanished. And Dinkie and Poppsy are already getting
acquainted with their neighbors. A Ford truck
came within an inch of running over Poppsy this
morning. She has announced a curiosity to investigate
ice-cream sodas, and Dinkie has proclaimed his
intention of going to the movies Saturday afternoon
with Benny McArthur, the banker&#8217;s son in the next
block. On Monday I&#8217;m to take my children to
school. &#8220;One of the finest school-buildings in all the
West,&#8221; Duncan has proudly explained. I can&#8217;t help
thinking of Gershom and his little cubby-hole of a
wooden building where he is even now so solemnly and
yet so kind-heartedly teaching the three R&#8217;s to a
gathering of little prairie outlaws.</p>
<p>I shall have time on my hands, I see, for Hilton
and his wife, our English gardener-chauffeur and our
portly maid-of-all-work, pretty well cover what the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303' name='page_303'></a>303</span>
wonderful Tokudo overlooks. And Tokudo <i>is</i> a wonder.
That cat-footed little Jap does the ordering
and cooking and serving; he answers the door and
the telephone; he attends to the rugs and the hardwood
floors; he rules over the butler&#8217;s pantry and
polishes the silver and inspects the linen, and even
keeps the keys to Duncan&#8217;s carefully guarded wine-cellar,
which the mistress of the house herself has not
yet dared to invade.</p>
<p>My husband seems to be very busy with his coal-mines
and his other interests. He said last night that
his idea of happiness is to be so immersed in his work
as to be unconscious of time and undisturbed by its
passing. And he <i>has</i> been happy, in that way. But
Time, that patient remodeler of all things mortal,
can still work while we sleep. And something has
been happening, without Duncan quite knowing it.
He has changed. He is older, for one thing. I don&#8217;t
mean that my husband is an old man. But I can see
a number of early-autumnal alterations in him. He&#8217;s
a trifle heavier and stiffer. He&#8217;s lost a bit of his
springiness. And he seems to know it, in his secret
heart of hearts, for he tries to make up for that loss
with a sort of coerced blitheness which doesn&#8217;t always
carry. He affects a sort of creaking jauntiness which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304' name='page_304'></a>304</span>
sometimes falls short of its aim. When he can&#8217;t clear
the hurdle, I notice, he has the habit of whipping up
his tired spirits with a cocktail or a highball or a
silver-fizz. But he is preoccupied, at times. And at
other times he is disturbingly short-tempered. He
announced this morning, almost gruffly, that we&#8217;d
had about enough of this &#8220;Dinkie and Poppsy business,&#8221;
and the children might as well be called by
their real names. So I shall make another effort to
get back to &#8220;Elmer&#8221; and &#8220;Pauline Augusta.&#8221; But
I feel, in my bones, that those pompous appellatives
will not be always remembered. It has just occurred
to me that my old habit of calling my husband
&#8220;Dinky-Dunk&#8221; has slipped away from me. Endearing
diminutives, I suppose, are not elicited by polar
bears.</p>

<h2><i>Thursday the Thirty-First</i></h2>
</div>
<p>I don&#8217;t quite know what&#8217;s the matter with me. I&#8217;m
like a cat in a strange garret. I don&#8217;t seem to be
fitting in. I sat at the piano last night playing
&#8220;What&#8217;s this dull town to me, Robin Adair?&#8221; And
Duncan, with the fit and natural spirit of the home-booster,
actively resented that oblique disparagement
of his new business-center. He believes implicitly in
Calgary and its future.</p>
<p>As for myself, I am rigidly suspending all judgments.
I&#8217;m at least trying to play my part, even
though my spirit isn&#8217;t in it. There are times when
I&#8217;m tempted to feel that a foot-hill city of this size
is neither fish nor fowl. It impresses me as a frontier
cow-town grown out of its knickers and still ungainly
in its first long trousers. But I can&#8217;t help
being struck by people&#8217;s incorruptible pride in their
own community. It&#8217;s a sort of religious faith, a fixed
belief in the future, a stubborn optimism that is
surely something more than self-interest. It&#8217;s the
Dutch courage that makes deprivation and long waiting
endurable.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306' name='page_306'></a>306</span></p>
<p>It&#8217;s the women, and the women alone, who seem left
out of the procession. They impress me as having
no big interests of their own, so they are compelled
to <i>playtend</i> with make-believe interests. They race
like mad in the social squirrel-cage, or drug themselves
with bridge and golf and the country club, or
take to culture with a capital C and read papers
culled from the Encyclopedias; or spend their husbands&#8217;
money on year-old Paris gowns and make love
to other women&#8217;s mates. The altitude, I imagine,
has quite a little to do with the febrile pace of things
here. Or perhaps it&#8217;s merely because I&#8217;m an old
frump from a back-township ranch!</p>
<p>But I have no intention of trying to keep up with
them, for I have a constitutional liking for quietness
in my old age. And I can&#8217;t engross myself in their
social aspirations, for I&#8217;ve seen a bit too much of
the world to be greatly taken with the internecine
jealousies of a twenty-year-old foot-hill town. My
&#8220;day&#8221; in this aristocratic section is Thursday, and
Tokudo this afternoon admitted callers from seven
closed cars, two landaulets, three Detroit electrics
and one hired taxi. I know, because I counted &#8217;em.
The children and I posed like a Raeburn group and
did our best to be respectable, for Duncan&#8217;s sake.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span>
But he seems to have taken up with some queer people
here, people who drop in at any time of the evening
and smoke and drink and solemnly discuss how a
shandygaff should be mixed and tell stories I
wouldn&#8217;t care to have the children hear.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s one couple Duncan asked me to be
especially nice to, a Mr. and Mrs. Murchison. The
latter, I find, is usually addressed as &#8220;Slinkie&#8221; by
her friends, and the former is known as &#8220;Cattalo
Charley&#8221; because he once formed a joint-stock company
which was to make a fortune interbreeding buffalo
and range-cattle, the product of that happy
union being known, I believe, as &#8220;cattalo.&#8221; Duncan
calls him a &#8220;promoter,&#8221; but my earlier impression of
him as a born gambler has been confirmed by the
report that he&#8217;s interested in a lignite briquetting
company, that he&#8217;s fathering a scheme, not only to
raise stock-yard reindeer in the sub-Arctics but also
to grow karakule sheep in the valleylands of the
Coast, that he once sold mummy wheat at forty dollars
a bushel, and that in the old boom days he promoted
no less than three oil companies. And the
time will come, Duncan avers, when that man will be
a millionaire.</p>
<p>As for &#8220;Slinkie,&#8221; his wife, I can&#8217;t be quite sure
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_308' name='page_308'></a>308</span>
whether I like her or not. I at least admire her
audacity and her steel-trap quickness of mind. She
has a dead white skin, green eyes, and most wonderful
hair, hair the color of a well-polished copper samovar.
She is an extremely thin woman who affects sheathe
skirts and rather reminds me of a boa-constrictor.
She always reeks of <i>Apres londre</i> and uses a lip-stick
as freely before the world as an orchestra conductor
uses a baton or a street-sweeper a broom. She is
nervous and sharp-tongued and fearless and I
thought, at first, that she was making a dead set at
my Duncan. But I can now see how she confronts
all men with that same dangerous note of intimacy.
Her real name is Lois. She talks about her convent
days in Belgium, sings <i>risque</i> songs in very bad
French, and smokes and drinks a great deal more
than is good for her. In Vancouver, when informed
that she was waiting for a street-car on a non-stop
corner, she sat down between the tracks, with her
back to the approaching car. The motorman, of
course, had to come to a stop&mdash;whereupon she arose
with dignity and stepped aboard. Duncan has told
me this story twice, and tends to consider Lois a
really wonderful character. I am a little afraid of
her. She asked me the other day how I liked Calgary.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_309' name='page_309'></a>309</span>
I responded, according to Hoyle, that I liked the
clear air and the clean streets and the Rockies looking
so companionably down over one&#8217;s shoulder. Lois
hooted as she tapped a cigarette end against her
hennaed thumb-nail.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just wait until the sand-storms, my dear!&#8221; she
said as she struck a match on her slipper-heel.</p>

<p>My old friend Gershom has very slyly written a
<i>rondeau</i> to me. I have just found it enclosed in my
<i>Golden Treasury</i>, which he handed back to me that
last night at Casa Grande. It&#8217;s the first actual
<i>rondeau</i> I ever had indited to my humble self, and
while I&#8217;m a bit set up about it, I can&#8217;t quite detach
from Gershom&#8217;s lines a vaguely obituarial atmosphere
which tends to depress me.</p>
<p>I can see that it may not be the best <i>rondeau</i> in the
world, but I&#8217;m going to keep it until my bones are
dust, for good old Gershom&#8217;s sake. And some day,
when he marries the nice girl he deserves to marry,
and has a kiddy or two of his own, I&#8217;ll shame his gray
hairs by parading it before his offspring! I have
just been re-reading the lines, in Gershom&#8217;s copperplate
script. They are as follows:</p>

<h2><i>Tuesday the Fifth</i></h2>
</div>
<p>The weather is balmier, and just a tinge of green
is creeping into the tan of the foot-hill slopes.
Spring is coming again.</p>
<p>I went shopping in the Hudson Bay Store yesterday
and found it much more metropolitan than I had
expected. And I find I am three whole laps behind
in that steeplechase known as Style. But I got a
raft of things for Pauline Augusta, and a Boy Scout
outfit for my laddie.</p>
<p>One of the few women I like in Calgary is Dinkie&#8217;s&mdash;I
mean Elmer&#8217;s&mdash;new school-teacher. Her name
is Lossie Brown and she is an earnest-eyed girl who&#8217;s
saving up to go to Europe some day and study art.
She&#8217;s a trifle shy, and unmistakably moody, but her
mind is as bright as a new pin. And some bright
morning, when the rose of womanhood has really
opened, she&#8217;s going to wake up a howling beauty. I
love her, too, for the interest she has taken in my boy,
whom she reports as getting along much better than
she had expected. So I have asked her to write a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_313' name='page_313'></a>313</span>
little note to Gershom Binks, advising him of his ex-pupil&#8217;s
advance. For Lossie is a girl I&#8217;d like Gershom
to know. And she has done this for me. I
ask her over to the house as often as I can and yesterday
I had Dinkie slip a little platinum-banded
fountain-pen, with a card, into the pocket of her
rather threadbare ulster. Duncan, however, is not
in the least interested in Lossie. He despises what he
calls insignificant people.</p>
<p>On my way home from shopping I had Hilton drive
me about some of the less-known parts of the city.
And I have been compelled to recast some of my
earlier impressions of Calgary. It is wonderful, in
many ways, and some day, I can see, it will be beautiful,
just as Lossie Brown will some day be beautiful.</p>
<p>In the first place, it is so happily situated, lying
as it does half-way between the mountains and the
plain. And the blue Bow comes dancing so joyously
down from the Rockies and the older city sleeps so
happily in the sunny crook of its valley-arm, while
the newer suburbs seem to boil up and run over the
surrounding hills like champagne bubbling over the
rim of a glass. There are raw edges, of course, but
time will eventually attend to these. Now and then,
between the motor-cars, you will see a creaking Red
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_314' name='page_314'></a>314</span>
River cart. Next to an office-building of gray sandstone
you&#8217;re likely to spot what looks like a squatter&#8217;s
wickyup of rusty galvanized iron. Yesterday,
on our main street where the electric-cars were clanging
and the limousines were throwing their exhaust
incense to the gods of the future, I caught sight of a
lonely and motionless figure, isolated in the midst of
a newer world. It was the figure of a Cree squaw,
blanketed and many-wrinkled and unmistakably
dirty, blinking at the devil-wagons and the ceaseless
hurry of the white man. And being somewhat Indianized,
as my husband once assured me I was, I could
sympathize with that stolid old lady in the blanket.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m even beginning to find that one can get tired of
optimism, especially when it is being so plainly converted
from a psychic abstraction into a municipal
asset. There&#8217;s a sort of communal Christian Science
in this place which ordains that thought shall not
dwell on such transient evils as drought or black rust
or early frost or hail-storms or money stringencies.
And there&#8217;s a sort of youthful greediness in people&#8217;s
longing to live all there is of life to live and to know
all there is of life to know. For there is a limit to
the sensations we can digest, just as there is a limit
to the meat we can digest. And out here we have a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_315' name='page_315'></a>315</span>
tendency to bolt more than is good for us, to bolt it
without pausing to get the true taste of it. The
women of this town remind me more and more of mice
in an oxygen bell; they race round and round, drunk
with an excitement they can&#8217;t quite understand, until
they burn up their little lives the same as the mice
burn up their little lungs.</p>
<p>... I&#8217;ve had a letter from Whinstane Sandy to-day,
writing about seed-wheat and the repairs for
the tractor. It seems like a message from another
world. He reports that poor old Scotty is eating
again and no longer mourns day in and day out for
his lost master. And Mr. Ketley has very kindly
brought over the liniment for Mudski&#8217;s shoulder.
... Whatever I may be, or whatever I may have
done, I feel that I can still cleanse my heart by sacrifice.</p>

<p>One can get out of the habit, apparently, of having
children about. My kiddies, I begin to see,
occasionally grate on Duncan. He brought tears to
the eyes of Pauline Augusta yesterday by the way he
scolded her for using a lead-pencil on the living-room
woodwork. And the night before he shouted much
strong language at Elmer for breaking a window-pane
in the garage with Benny McArthur&#8217;s new air-gun.</p>
<p>Elmer and his father, I&#8217;m afraid, have rather
grown away from each other. More than once I&#8217;ve
caught Duncan staring at his son and heir in a
puzzled and a slightly frustrated sort of way. And
Elmer&#8217;s soul promptly becomes <i>incommunicado</i> when
his iron-browed pater is in the neighborhood.</p>
<p>Duncan is very proud of his grand new house. He
is anxious to build a conservatory out along the
southwest wing. But he has asked how long a conservatory
would last with two young mountain-goats
gamboling along its leads.... Lossie, little suspecting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_317' name='page_317'></a>317</span>
the pang she was giving me, laughingly
showed me a manuscript which she found by accident
in my Dinkie&#8217;s reader. It was a poem, dedicated to
&#8220;D. O&#8217;L.&#8221; And written in a stiff little hand I read:</p>
<table style='margin: auto' summary=''><tr><td>
<p style='margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;'>
&#8220;Your lips are lined with roses,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 0.78125em;'>Your eyes they shinne like gold</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 0.78125em;'>I&#8217;ll answer from the cold.</span><br />
But I wonder why, Oh, why,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 0.78125em;'>You stay so far from me?</span><br />
If you whisper from the prarrie,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 0.78125em;'>I&#8217;ll call from Calgary.&#8221;</span></p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t it be wonderful,&#8221; said Lossie as I sat pondering
over those foolish little lines, &#8220;won&#8217;t it be wonderful,
if Dinkie grows up to be a great poet?&#8221;</p>

</div>
<p>Elmer, <i>alias</i> Dinkie, after many days&#8217; mourning
for his lost Scotty, is consoling himself, as other men
do, with a substitute. Last Friday he Brought home
a flop-eared pup with a drooping tail and an indefinite
ancestry, explaining that he had come into possession
of the aforementioned animal by the duly
delivered purchase-price of thirty-seven cents.</p>
<p>Remembering Minty and certain matters of the
past, I was troubled in spirit. But I couldn&#8217;t see
why my son shouldn&#8217;t have an animal to love. And I
have had Hilton fix a little box in one corner of the
garage for Dinkie&#8217;s new pet, which he has christened
Rowdy.</p>
<p>Rowdy, I now see, is a canine of limited spirit and
is not likely to repeat the offenses of Minty. But
Dinkie really loves his new pup, despite the latter&#8217;s
indubitably democratic ancestry. And I begin to
suspect that my laddie&#8217;s weakness for mongrels may
arise from his earlier experience with Duncan&#8217;s
blooded bulldog, which he struggled with for three
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_319' name='page_319'></a>319</span>
whole days, fondly and foolishly trying to teach that
stolid animal the art of &#8220;pointing.&#8221;</p>
<p>On Saturday Dinkie smuggled the verminous
Rowdy to the upper bathroom and gave him a thorough
but quite unrelished soaping ... Dinkie, by
the way, is now a &#8220;cub&#8221; in the Boy Scouts and
after adorning himself in khaki goes off on hikes and
takes lessons in woodcraft. Saturday the Scouts of
his school marched behind a real band and Lossie
and I sat in the car waiting for my laddie to appear.
He wiggled one hand, and smiled sheepishly, as he
caught sight of us. But he kept &#8220;eyes front&#8221; and
refused to give any further sign as he marched
bravely on behind that brave music. He is learning
the law of the pack. For some first frail ideas of
service are beginning to incubate in that egoistic
little bean of his. And he&#8217;s suffering, I suppose, the
old contest between the ancestral lust to kill and the
new-born inclination to succor and preserve. That
means he may some day be &#8220;a gentleman.&#8221; And I&#8217;ve
a weakness for that old Newman definition of a gentleman
as one who never inflicts pain&mdash;&#8220;tender
towards the bashful, gentle towards the distant, and
merciful towards the absurd&#8221;&mdash;conducting himself
toward his enemy as if he were some day to be his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_320' name='page_320'></a>320</span>
friend. And I also wish there were a few more of
them in this hard old world of ours!</p>
<p>Speaking of gentlemen, there&#8217;s a Captain Goodhue
here whom I rather like. Lois Murchison brought us
together in the tea-room of the Palliser. In more
ways than one he reminds me of Peter. But Captain
Goodhue is a much older man, and is English, coming
from a very excellent family in Sussex. He&#8217;s one of
those iron-gray ex-Army men who still believe in a
monocle and can be loyal to a queen even though she
wears a basque with darts in it. And he doesn&#8217;t talk
to a woman with that ragging air of condescension
which seems to be peculiar to western American civilization.
He is courteous and thoughtful and sincere,
though I noticed that he winced a trifle when I suddenly
remembered, as he was taking his departure,
that the McKails were living in what must have once
been his house. He blinked, like a well-groomed old
eagle, when I reminded him of this. I never dreamed,
of course, that the subject would be painful to him.
But it was an honor, he acknowledged with a bow, to
pass his household gods on to a lady to whom so
much had already been given.</p>
<p>When I asked Lois about it, later on, she rather
indifferently acknowledged that the old gentleman
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_321' name='page_321'></a>321</span>
had been making a mess of his different business ventures.
He was much better at golf than getting
in on the ground-floor of a land deal. He was too
old fogy, said Slinkie, to make good in the West.
He still kept his head up, but they&#8217;d pretty well
picked him to the bones.... Lois, by the way,
describes me as something new in her menagerie and
drops in to see me at the most unexpected moments.
Then her tongue goes like a mower-knife. She is
persuaded that I should permanent-wave my hair,
lower my waist-line, and go in for amethysts. &#8220;And
interest yourself, my dear, in an outside man or
two,&#8221; she has sagely advised me. &#8220;For husbands, you&#8217;ll
find, always accept you at the other mutt&#8217;s valuation!&#8221;</p>
<p>I was tempted to make her open her jade-green
eyes, for a moment, by telling her I was already
interested in an outside man or two and that my lord
and master hadn&#8217;t been much influenced by the extraneous
appreciations. But I&#8217;m a little afraid of
Slinkie and her serpent&#8217;s tongue. And I&#8217;m a little
afraid of this new circle into which my Duncan has
so laboriously engineered himself. They more and
more impress on my simple old prairie soul that the
single-track woman is the woman who gets most out
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_322' name='page_322'></a>322</span>
of life, that there&#8217;s nothing really great and nothing
really enduring that is not built on loyalty and truth.
Character is Fate, as I once before inscribed in this
book of my life. And I&#8217;ve been sitting up to-night,
while the eternal bridge game is going on below, asking
myself if all is well with Chaddie McKail. Have
I, or have I not, conceded too much? Am I turning
into nothing more than a mush of concession?
Haven&#8217;t I been bribed by comfort, and blinded to a
situation which I am now almost afraid to face?
Haven&#8217;t I been selfishly scheming for the welfare of
my children and endangering all their future and my
own by the price I am paying? Haven&#8217;t I been
crazily manning a rickety old pump, trying to keep
afloat a family hulk whose seams are wide open and
whose timbers are water-logged? And how long can
this sort of thing go on? And what will be the end
of it?</p>
<p>I try to warn myself not to smash my goods to kill
a rat, as the Chinese say. I try to flatter myself that
I am not letting circumstances stampede me into any
hasty decision. There&#8217;s many a woman, I suppose,
with a husband whose legal promise has outlived his
loyalty. But all is not well here about my heart. I
know that, by the way it keeps sending up little trial-balloons,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_323' name='page_323'></a>323</span>
to see which way the wind is really blowing.</p>
<p>... And Sunday night Cattalo Charlie went home
quite drunk. And our local member, emboldened by
his seventh highball, offhandedly invited me to accompany
him on a little run up to Banff, stabbing me
with a hurt look when I told him I&#8217;d see when Duncan
could get away from his work....</p>
<p>I wonder if spring is coming to Casa Grande?
And at Alabama Ranch? And are the pussy-willows
showing in the slough-ends? And why doesn&#8217;t Peter
Ketley ever write to me?</p>

<p>Lossie and Gershom, I find, have drifted into the
habit of writing to each other. It is, of course, all
purely platonic and pedagogic, arising out of a common
interest in my Dinkie&#8217;s academic advancement.
But Lossie borrowed Dinkie this morning to have a
photograph taken with him, one copy of which she
has very generously promised to send on to Gershom....
Struthers has sent me a very satisfactory
report from Casa Grande, which I dreamed last night
had burned to the ground, compelling me and my kiddies
to live in the old prairie-schooner, laboriously
pulled about the prairie by Tithonus and Calamity
Kate. And when I applied at Peter&#8217;s door for a
handful of meal for my starving children, he called
me worse than a fallen woman and drove me off into
the wilderness.</p>
<p>Duncan asked me to-day if I&#8217;d motor up to the
mines with him for the week-end. I had to tell him
that I&#8217;d promised to take Elmer and Pauline
Augusta to hear Kathleen Parlow and that it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_325' name='page_325'></a>325</span>
wouldn&#8217;t seem quite fair to break my word. Duncan
said that I was the best judge of that. Then he
slammed a drawer shut and asked me, in his newer
manner, how long I intended to pull this iceberg
stuff. &#8220;For I can&#8217;t see,&#8221; he concluded after calling
out for Tokudo to bring his hat and coat, &#8220;that I&#8217;m
getting such a hell of a lot out of this arrangement!&#8221;</p>
<p>I asked him, as quietly as I could, what he expected
of me. But I could feel my heart pounding quick
against my ribs. I am not, and never pretended to
be, any stained-glass saint. And there were a few
things I felt it was about time to unload. But
Tokudo cat-footed back with the coat, and I could
hear Lossie&#8217;s clear laugh as she came in through the
front door with the returning Dinkie, and some inner
voice warned me to hold my peace. So Duncan and
I merely stood there staring at each other, for a
moment or two, across an abysmal and unbridgeable
gulf of silence. Then he strode out to his car without
as much as a howdy-do to the startled and slightly
mystified Lossie.</p>

<p>I have just learned that we were blackballed from
the Country Club. My husband, at least, has met
with that experience.</p>
<p>It was Lois who let the cat out of the bag. She
wasn&#8217;t clear on all the details, but it was that old has-been
of a Goodhue who was at the bottom of it all,
according to the lady known as Slinkie. Duncan
and he had clashed, from the first. Then Duncan had
bought up his paper, and compelled him to mortgage
his home. It was because of something to do with the
Barcona Mines directorate, Lois thought, that Captain
Goodhue had had Duncan blackballed when he
applied for membership in the Country Club, the
Captain being vice-president of the original holding
company. Lois laughed none too pleasantly when she
added that her Charley and my Duncan had joined
hands to go after the old man&#8217;s scalp. And they had
got it. They turned him inside out, before they got
through with him. They took his fore-lock and his
teepee and his last string of wampum. And the old
snob, of course, would never forgive them.</p>
<p>... They took his fore-lock, and his teepee ...
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_327' name='page_327'></a>327</span>
And it was Chaddie McKail and her bairns who were
now housing warm in that captured teepee! And all
this toiling and moiling, on the part of my husband,
all this scheming and intriguing and juggling with
figures, had been a campaign for power, a plotting
and working to get even with this haughty old enemy
who could carry his defeat so lightly! To be blackballed
like that, I remembered, was to be proclaimed
not a gentleman. And it must have cut deep. At one
time, I suppose, Duncan would have called his monocled
captain out. But men seem to fight differently
nowadays. They fight differently, but no less grimly.
And Duncan, whether it is a virtue or a vice in his
make-up, would always be a fighter.... Yet I have
no sense of gratitude to Lois Murchison for depositing
her painful truths in my lap. She warned me, in
her artless soprano, that there wasn&#8217;t much good in
sentimentalizing the situation. But she has thrown
a shadow across the house which I was trying to make
into a home. Without quite knowing it, she has
cheapened her life-mate in my eyes. Without quite
intending it, she has left my own husband more ignominious
than he once stood. I was trying hard to
school myself into a respect for his material successes.
I was struggling to excuse a great many
things by the engrossing nature of his work. But the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_328' name='page_328'></a>328</span>
motive behind all his efforts seemed suddenly a sordid
one, in many ways a mean one.</p>
<p>I keep remembering what Lois said about not sentimentalizing
a situation. But I&#8217;m not yet such a mush
of concession that I can&#8217;t tell black from white. And
there&#8217;s some part of us, some vague but unescapable
part of us, which we must respect, otherwise we have
no right to walk God&#8217;s good earth....</p>
<p>I want to get away, for a day or two, to think
things out. I think, before Duncan gets back to-morrow,
I shall take Poppsy and run up to Banff.
I may get my view-point back. And the mountain
quietness may do me good....</p>
<p>I keep having that same dull ache of disappointment
which came to me as a girl, after I&#8217;d idolized a
great man called Meredith and after I&#8217;d almost
prayed to a great poet called Browning, on finding
that one was so imperfectly monogamous and that
the other philandered and talked foolishly to women.
I had thrust my girlish faith in their hands, as so
often befalls with the young, and they had betrayed
it.... But for the second time since I married, I
have been reading <i>Modern Love</i>. And I can almost
forgive the Apollo of Box Hill for that betrayal
which he knew nothing about.</p>

<h2><i>Thursday the Twenty-Eighth</i></h2>
</div>
<p>This is Thursday the twenty-eighth of April. I
want to be sure of that. For there are very few
things I can be sure of now.</p>
<p>The bottom has fallen out of my world. I sit here,
telling myself to be calm. But it&#8217;s not easy to sit
quiet when you face the very worst that all life could
confront you with. <i>My Dinkie has run away.</i></p>
<p>My boy has left me, has left his home, has vanished
like smoke into the Unknown. He is gone and I have
no trace of him.</p>
<p>I find it hard to write. Yet I <i>must</i> write, for the
mere expression of what I feel tends to ease the ache.
It helps to keep me sane. And already I realize I
was wrong when I wrote &#8220;the very worst that all life
could confront you with.&#8221; For my laddie, after all,
is not dead. He must still be alive. And while there&#8217;s
life, there&#8217;s hope.</p>
<p>I got back from Banff yesterday morning about
nine, and Hilton was there with the car to meet me,
as I had told him to be. I was anxious to know at
once if everything was all right, but I found it hard
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_330' name='page_330'></a>330</span>
to put a question so personal before that impersonal-eyed
Englishman. So I strove to give my interrogation
an air of the casual by offhandedly inquiring:
&#8220;How&#8217;s Rowdy, Hilton?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dead, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; was his prompt reply.</p>
<p>This rather took my breath away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mean to say that Rowdy is <i>dead</i>?&#8221; I
insisted, noticing Poppsy&#8217;s color change as she listened.</p>
<p>&#8220;Killed, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; said the laconic Hilton.</p>
<p>&#8220;By whom?&#8221; I demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Murchison, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; was the answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;How?&#8221; I asked, feeling my vague dislike for that
particular name sharpen up to something dangerously
like hatred.</p>
<p>&#8220;He always comes up the drive a bit fast-like,
ma&#8217;am. He hit the pup, and that was the end of
him!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Does Dinkie know?&#8221; was my first question, after
that.</p>
<p>&#8220;He <i>saw</i> it, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; admitted my car-driver.</p>
<p>&#8220;Saw what?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Saw Mr. Murchison throw the dog over the wall
into the brush!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What did he say?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_331' name='page_331'></a>331</span></p>
<p>&#8220;He swore a bit, ma&#8217;am, and then laughed,&#8221; admitted
Hilton, after a pause.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dinkie laughed?&#8221; I cried, incredulous.</p>
<p>&#8220;No; Mr. Murchison, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; explained Hilton.</p>
<p>&#8220;What did Dinkie say?&#8221; I insisted. And again the
man on the driving-seat remained silent a moment or
two.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was what he <i>did</i>, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; he finally remarked.</p>
<p>&#8220;What did he do?&#8221; I demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ran into the house, ma&#8217;am, and snatched the icepick
off the kitchen table. Then he went to the big
car like a mad &#8217;un, he did. Pounded holes in every
blessed tire with his pick!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And then what?&#8221; I asked, with my heart up in
my throat.</p>
<p>Hilton waited until he had taken a crowded corner
before answering.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then he found the dead dog, ma&#8217;am, and bathed
it, and borrowed the garden spade from me. Then
he took it somewheres back in the ravine and buried
it. I gave him the tool-box off the old roadster, to
put what was left of the pup in.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And then?&#8221; I prompted, with a quaver in my
voice I couldn&#8217;t control.</p>
<p>&#8220;He met Mr. Murchison coming out and he called
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_332' name='page_332'></a>332</span>
him w&#8217;at I&#8217;d not like to repeat, ma&#8217;am, until Mr.
McKail stepped out to see what was wrong, and
interfered.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>How</i> did he interfere?&#8221; was my next question.</p>
<p>&#8220;By taking the lad into the house, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; was my
witness&#8217;s retarded reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then what happened?&#8221; I exacted.</p>
<p>I waited, knowing what was coming, but I dreaded
to hear it.</p>
<p>&#8220;He gave him a threshing, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; I heard Hilton&#8217;s
voice saying, far away, as though it came to me
over a long-distance telephone on a wet night.</p>
<p>I sat rigid as we mounted American Hill. I sat
rigid as we swerved in through the ridiculous manor-like
gate and up the winding drive and in under the
ugly new porte-coch&egrave;re. I didn&#8217;t even wait for
Poppsy as I got out of the car. I didn&#8217;t even speak
to Tokudo as he ran mincingly to take my things. I
walked straight to the breakfast-room where I saw
my husband sitting at the end of the oblong white
table, stirring a cup of coffee with a spoon.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s Dinkie?&#8221; I asked, trying to keep my
voice low but not quite succeeding.</p>
<p>Duncan looked up at me with a coldly meditative
eye.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_333' name='page_333'></a>333</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Where he usually is at this time of day,&#8221; he
finally answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221; I repeated.</p>
<p>&#8220;At school, of course,&#8221; admitted my husband as he
reached out for a piece of buttered toast. He was
making a pretense at being very tranquil-minded.
But his hand, I noticed, wasn&#8217;t so steady as it might
have been.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is he all right?&#8221; I demanded, with my voice rising
in spite of myself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Considerably better, I imagine, than he has been
for some time,&#8221; was the deliberate answer from the
man with the bloodshot eyes at the end of the table.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean by that?&#8221; I asked. And any
one of intelligence, I suppose, could see I was making
that question a challenge.</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean that since you saw him last he&#8217;s had a
damned good whaling,&#8221; said Duncan, with his jaw
squared, so that he reminded me of a King-Lud bulldog.</p>
<p>I paid no attention to Tokudo, who came into the
room to repeat that his master was wanted at the
telephone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mean you struck that child?&#8221; I demanded,
leaning on the table and looking straight
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_334' name='page_334'></a>334</span>
into his eyes, which met mine quite unabashed, and
with an air of mockery about them.</p>
<p>My husband nodded as he pushed back his chair.</p>
<p>&#8220;He got a good one,&#8221; he asserted as he rose to his
feet and rather leisurely brushed a crumb or two
from his vest-front. He could even afford to smile
as he said it. My expression, I suppose, would have
made any man smile. But there was something maddening
in his mockery, at such a moment. There was
something gratuitously cruel in his parade of unconcern.
Yet, oddly enough, as I looked at his slightly
blotched face I couldn&#8217;t help remembering that that
was the face I had once kissed and held close against
my cheek, had <i>wanted</i> to hold against my cheek. And
now I hated it.</p>
<p>I had to wait and cast about for words of hatred
strong enough to carry the arrows of enmity which
nothing could stop me from delivering. But while I
waited Tokudo announced for the third time that my
husband was wanted at the telephone. And a very
simple thing happened. My husband answered his
call.</p>
<p>I saw Duncan turn and walk out of the room. I
could hear his steps in the hallway, loud on the waxed
hardwood and low on the rugs. I could hear his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_335' name='page_335'></a>335</span>
deliberated chest-tones as he talked over the wire, talked
quietly and earnestly, talked me and my hatred out
of his head and out of his world. And I realized, as I
sat there at the table-end with my gloves twisted up
under my hands and my heart even more twisted up
under my ribs, that it was all useless, that it was all
futile. He was beyond the reach of my resentment.
We were in different worlds, forevermore.</p>
<p>I was still sitting there when he looked in at the
door, with his hat and coat on, on his way out. I
could feel him there, without directly seeing him.
And I could feel, too, that he wanted to say something.
But I declined to lift my head, and I could
hear the door close as he went out to the waiting car.</p>
<p>I sat there for a long time, thinking about my
Dinkie. Twice I almost surrendered to the impulse
to telephone to Lossie Brown. But I knew it would
be no easy matter to get in touch with her. And in
two hours it would be twelve, and any minute after
that my boy would be home again. I tried to cross-examine
Tokudo, but I could get nothing out of that
tight-lipped Jap. I watched the clock. I noticed
Hilton, when he got back, raking blood-stains off the
gravel of the driveway. I wandered about, like a lost
turkey-hen, trying to dramatize my meeting with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_336' name='page_336'></a>336</span>
Dinkie, doing my best to cooper together some incident
which might keep our first minute or two
together from being too hard on my poor kiddie. I
heard the twelve o&#8217;clock whistles, at last, and then
the Westminster-chimes of the over-ornate clock in
the library announce that noon had come. And still
the minutes dragged on.</p>
<p>And when the tension was becoming almost unbearable
I heard a step on the gravel and my heart
started to pound.</p>
<p>But instead of Dinkie, it was Lossie, Lossie with
smiling lips and inquiring brown eyes and splashes of
rose in her cheeks from rapid walking.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s Dinkie?&#8221; I asked.</p>
<p>She stopped short, still smiling.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s exactly what I was going to ask?&#8221; I heard
her saying. Then her smile faded as she searched my
face. &#8220;There&#8217;s&mdash;there&#8217;s nothing happened, has
there?&#8221;</p>
<p>I groped my way to a pillar of the porte-coch&egrave;re
and leaned against it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t Dinkie come to school this morning?&#8221; I
asked as the earth wavered under my feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; acknowledged Lossie, still searching my
face. And a frown of perplexity came into her own.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_337' name='page_337'></a>337</span></p>
<p>I knew then what had happened. I knew it even
before I went up to Dinkie&#8217;s room and started my
frantic search through his things. I could see that
a number of his more treasured small possessions
were gone. I delved forlornly about, hoping that he
might have left some hidden message for me. But I
could find nothing. I sat looking at his books and
broken toys, at the still open copy of <i>The Count of
Monte Cristo</i> which he must have been poring over
only the night before, at his neatly folded underclothes
and the little row of gravel-worn shoes. They
took on an air of pathos, an atmosphere of the
memorial. Yet, oddly enough, it was Lossie, and
Lossie alone, who broke into tears. The more she
cried, in fact, the calmer I found myself becoming,
though all the while that dead weight of misery was
hanging like lead from my heart.</p>
<p>I went at once to the telephone and called up
Duncan&#8217;s office. He was still there, though I had to
wait several minutes before I could get in touch with
him.</p>
<p>I had thought, at first, that he would be offhandedly
skeptical at the message which I was sending
him over the wire, the message that my boy had
run away. He might even be flippantly indifferent,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_338' name='page_338'></a>338</span>
and remind me that much worse things could have
happened.</p>
<p>But I knew at once that he was genuinely alarmed
at the news which I&#8217;d given him. It apparently
staggered him for a moment. Then he said in his
curt telephonic chest-tones, &#8220;I&#8217;ll be up at the house,
at once.&#8221;</p>
<p>He came, before I&#8217;d even completed a second and
more careful search. His face was cold and non-committal
enough, but his color was gone and there was
a look that was almost one of contrition in his
troubled eyes, which seemed unwilling to meet mine.
He questioned Lossie and cross-examined Hilton and
Tokudo, and then called up the Chief of Police. Then
he telephoned to the different railway stations, and
carried Lossie off in the car to the McArthurs&#8217;, to
interview Benny, and came back an hour later with
that vague look of frustration still on his face.</p>
<p>He sat down to luncheon, but he ate very little.
He was silent for quite a long time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your boy&#8217;s all right,&#8221; he said in a much softer
voice than I had expected from him. &#8220;He&#8217;s big
enough to look after himself. And we&#8217;ll be on his
trail before nightfall. He can&#8217;t go far.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No; he can&#8217;t go far,&#8221; I echoed, trying to fortify
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_339' name='page_339'></a>339</span>
myself with the knowledge that he must have taken
little more than a dollar from the gilded cast-iron
elephant which he used as a bank.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want this to get in the papers,&#8221; explained
my husband. &#8220;It&#8217;s&mdash;it&#8217;s all so ridiculous. I&#8217;ve put
Kearney and two of his men on the job. He&#8217;s a
private detective, and he&#8217;ll keep busy until he gets the
boy back.&#8221;</p>
<p>Duncan got up from the table, rather heavily. He
stood hesitating a moment and then stepped closer
to my chair.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know it&#8217;s hard,&#8221; he said as he put a hand on my
shoulder. &#8220;But it&#8217;ll be all right. We&#8217;ll get your
boy back for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t speak, because I knew that if I spoke I&#8217;d
break down and make an idiot of myself. My husband
waited, apparently expecting me to say something.
Then he took his hand away.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll get busy with the car,&#8221; he said with a forced
matter-of-factness, &#8220;and let you know when there&#8217;s
any news. I&#8217;ve wired Buckhorn and sent word to
Casa Grande&mdash;and we ought to get some news from
there.&#8221;</p>
<p>But there was no news. The afternoon dragged
away and the house seemed like a tomb. And at five
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_340' name='page_340'></a>340</span>
o&#8217;clock I did what I had wanted to do for six long
hours. I sent off a forty-seven word telegram to
Peter Ketley, telling him what had happened....</p>
<p>Duncan came back, at seven o&#8217;clock, to get one of
the new photographs of Dinkie and Lossie for identification
purposes. They had rounded up a small boy
at Morley and Kearney was motoring out to investigate.
We&#8217;d know by midnight....</p>
<p>It is well after midnight, and Duncan has just
had a phone-message from Morley. The little chap
they had rounded up was a Barnado boy fired with
a sudden ambition to join his uncle in the gold-fields
of Australia. Somewhere, in the blackness of this
big night, my homeless Dinkie is wandering unguarded
and alone.</p>

<p>I have had no word from Peter.... I&#8217;ve had no
news to end the ache that pins me like a spear-head
to the wall of hopelessness. Duncan, I know, is doing
all he can. But there is so little to do. And this

</div>
<p>I was called to the phone before breakfast this
morning and it was the blessed voice of Peter I heard
from the other end of the wire. My telegram had
got out to him from Buckhorn a day late. But he
had no definite news for me. He was quite fixed in
his belief, however, that Dinkie would be bobbing up
at his old home in a day or two.</p>
<p>&#8220;The boy will travel this way,&#8221; he assured me.
&#8220;He&#8217;s bound to do that. It&#8217;s as natural as water
running down-hill!&#8221;</p>
<p>Duncan asked me whom I&#8217;d been talking to, and
I had to tell him. His face clouded and the familiar
quick look of resentment came into his eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t see what that Quaker&#8217;s got to do with this
question,&#8221; he barked out. But I held my peace.</p>

<h2><i>Sunday the First</i></h2>
</div>
<p>I have found a message from my Dinkie. I came
across it this morning, by accident. It was in my
sewing-basket, the basket made of birch-bark and
stained porcupine quills and lined with doe-skin,
which I&#8217;d once bought from a Reservation squaw in
Buckhorn with a tiny papoose on her back. Duncan
had upbraided me for passing out my last five-dollar
bill to that hungry Nitchie, but the poor woman
needed it.</p>
<p>My fingers were shaking as I unfolded the note.
And written there in the script I knew so well I read:</p>
<p style='margin-left:1.0em; margin-right:1.0em; '>&#8220;Darligest Mummsey:</p>
<p style='margin-left:1.0em; margin-right:1.0em; '>I am going away. But dont worry about me for
I will be alright. I couldn&#8217;t stay Mummsey after
what hapened. Some day I will come back to you.
But I&#8217;m not as bad as all that. I&#8217;ll love you always
as much as ever. I can take care for myself so don&#8217;t
worry, please. And please feed my two rabits reglar
and tell Benny I&#8217;ll save his jacknife and rember
every day I&#8217;m rembering you. X X X X X X X</p>
<p style='margin-left:1.0em; margin-right:1.0em; '>Your aff&#8217;cte son,</p>
<p style='margin-left:1.0em; margin-right:1.0em; text-align:right'><span style='font-variant:small-caps'>Dinkie</span>.&#8221;<br /></p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_344' name='page_344'></a>344</span></div>
<p>It seemed like a voice from the dead, it was bittersweet
consolation, and, in a way, it stood redemption
of Dinkie himself. I&#8217;d been upbraiding him, in my
secret heart of hearts, for his silence to his mother.
That&#8217;s a streak of his father in him, had been my
first thought, that unthinking cruelty which didn&#8217;t
take count of the anguish of others. But he hadn&#8217;t
forgotten me. Whatever happens, I have at least
this assuaging secret message from my son. And
some day he&#8217;ll come back to me. &#8220;Ye winna leave me
for a&#8217;, laddie?&#8221; I keep saying, in the language of old
Whinstane Sandy. And my mind goes back, almost
six years at a bound, to the time he was lost on the
prairie. That time, I tell myself, God was good to
me. And surely He will be good to me again!</p>

<h2><i>Tuesday the Third</i></h2>
</div>
<p>We still have no single word of our laddie....
They all tell me not to worry. But how can a mother
keep from worrying? I had rather an awful nightmare
last night, dreaming that Dinkie was trying to
climb the stone wall about our place. He kept falling
back with bleeding fingers, and he kept calling and
calling for his mother. Without being quite awake
I went down to the door in my night-gown, and
opened it, and called out into the darkness: &#8220;Is anybody
there? Is it you, Dinkie?&#8221;</p>
<p>My husband came down and led me back to bed,
with rather a frightened look on his face.</p>
<p>They tell me not to worry, but I&#8217;ve been up in
Dinkie&#8217;s room turning over his things and wondering
if he&#8217;s dead, or if he&#8217;s fallen into the hands of cruel
people who would ill-use a child. Or perhaps he has
been stolen by Indians, and will come back to me with
a morose and sullen mind, and with scars on his
body....</p>

</div>
<p>What a terrible thing is loneliness. The floors of
Hell, I&#8217;m sure, are paved with lonesome hearts. Day
by day I wait and long for my laddie. Always, at
the back of my brain, is that big want. Day by day
I brood about him and night by night I dream of him.
I turn over his old playthings and his books, and my
throat gets tight. I stare at the faded old snap-shots
of him, and my heart turns to lead. I imagine
I hear his voice, just outside the door, or just beyond
a bend in the road, and a two-bladed sword of pain
pushes slowly through my breast-bone. Dear old
Lossie comes twice a day, and does her best to cheer
me up. And Gershom has offered to give up his
school and join in the search. Peter Ketley, he tells
me, has been on the road for a week, in a car covered
with mud and clothes that have never come off.</p>

</div>
<p>There is no news of my Dinkie. And <i>that</i>, I
remind myself, is the only matter that counts.</p>
<p>Lois Murchison drove up to-day in her hateful big
car. She did not find me a very agreeable hostess,
I&#8217;m afraid, but curled up like a nonchalant green
snake in one of my armchairs and started to smoke
and talk. She asked where Duncan was and I had
to explain that he&#8217;d been called out to the mines on
imperative business. And that started her going on
the mines. Duncan, she said, should clean up half
a million before he was through with that deal. He
had been very successful.</p>
<p>&#8220;But don&#8217;t you feel, my dear,&#8221; she went on with
quiet venom in her voice, &#8220;that a great deal of his
success has depended on that bandy-legged little she-secretary
of his?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is she that wonderful?&#8221; I asked, trying to seem
less at sea than I was.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s certainly wonderful to him!&#8221; announced the
woman known as Slinkie. And having driven that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_348' name='page_348'></a>348</span>
poisoned dart well into the flesh, she was content to
drop her cigarette-end into the ash-receiver, reach for
her blue-fox furs, and announce that she&#8217;d have to
be toddling on to the hair-dresser&#8217;s.</p>
<p>Lois Murchison&#8217;s implication, at that moment,
didn&#8217;t bother me much, for I had bigger troubles to
occupy my thoughts. But the more I dwell on it,
the more I find myself disturbed in spirit. I resent
the idea of being upset by a wicked-tongued woman.
She has, however, raised a ghost which will have to
be laid. To-morrow I intend to go down to my husband&#8217;s
office and see his secretary, &#8220;to inspect the
whaup,&#8221; as Whinnie would express it, for I find
myself becoming more and more interested in her
wonderfulness.... Peter sent me a hurried line or
two to-day, telling me to sit tight as he thought he&#8217;d
have news for me before the week was out.</p>
<p>I suspect him of trying to trick me into some forlorn
new lease of hope. But I have pinned my faith
to Peter&mdash;and I know he would not trifle with anything
so sacred as mother-love.</p>

<h2><i>Saturday the Seventh</i></h2>
</div>
<p>There is no news of my Dinkie.... But there is
news of another nature.</p>
<p>Between ten and eleven this morning I had Hilton
motor me down to Duncan&#8217;s office in Eighth Avenue.
It struck me as odd, at first, that I had never been
there before. But Duncan, I remembered, had never
asked me, the domestic fly, to step into his spider&#8217;s
parlor of commerce. And I found a ridiculous
timidity creeping over me as I went up in the elevator,
and found the door-number, and saw myself
confronted by a cadaverous urchin in horn-rimmed
specs, who thrust a paper-covered novel behind his
chair-back and asked me what I wanted. So I asked
him if this was Mr. McKail&#8217;s office.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; he said in the established vernacular of
the West.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is your name, little boy?&#8221; I inquired,
with the sternest brand of condescension I could command.</p>
<p>The young monkey drew himself up at that and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_350' name='page_350'></a>350</span>
flushed angrily. &#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know as I&#8217;m so little,&#8221;
he observed, regarding me with a narrowing eye as
I stepped unbidden beyond the sacred portals.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where will I find Mr. McKail&#8217;s secretary?&#8221; I
asked, noticing the door in the stained-wood partition
with &#8220;Private&#8221; on its frosted glass. The youth
nodded his head toward the door in question and
crossed to a desk where he proceeded languidly to
affix postage-stamps to a small pile of envelopes.</p>
<p>I hesitated for a moment, as though there was
something epochal in the air, as though I was making
a step which might mean a great deal to me. And
then I stepped over to the door and opened it.</p>
<p>I saw a young woman seated at a flat-topped desk,
with a gold-banded fountain-pen in her fingers, checking
over a column of figures. She checked carefully
on to the end of her column, and then she raised her
head and looked at me.</p>
<p>Her face stood out with singular distinctness, in
the strong side-light from the office-window. And
the woman seated at the flat-topped desk was Alsina
Teeswater.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know how long I stood there without speaking.
But I could see the color slowly mount and
recede on Alsina Teeswater&#8217;s face. She put down
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_351' name='page_351'></a>351</span>
her fountain-pen, with much deliberation, and sat
upright in her chair, with her barricaded eyes every
moment of the time on my face.</p>
<p>&#8220;So this has started again?&#8221; I finally said, in little
more than a whisper.</p>
<p>I could see the girl&#8217;s lips harden. I could see her
fortifying herself behind an entrenchment of quietly
marshaled belligerency.</p>
<p>&#8220;It has never stopped, Mrs. McKail,&#8221; she said in
an equally low voice, but with the courage of utter
desperation.</p>
<p>It took some time, apparently, for that declaration
to filter through to my brain. Everything
seemed suddenly out of focus; and it was hard to readjust
vision to the newer order of things. But I was
calmer, under the circumstances, than I expected to be.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad I understand,&#8221; I finally admitted.</p>
<p>The woman at the desk seemed puzzled. Then she
looked from me to her column of figures and from her
column of figures to the huddled roofs and walls of
the city and the greening foot-hills and the solemn
white crowns of the Rockies behind them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you quite sure, Mrs. McKail, that you do
understand?&#8221; she asked at last, with just a touch of
challenge in the question.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_352' name='page_352'></a>352</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it quite simple now?&#8221; I demanded.</p>
<p>She found the courage to face me again.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think this sort of thing is ever simple,&#8221;
she replied, with much more emotion than I had expected
of her.</p>
<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s at least clear how it must end,&#8221; I found
the courage to point out to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that clear to <i>you</i>?&#8221; demanded the woman who
was stepping into my shoes. It seemed odd, at the
moment, that I should feel vaguely sorry for her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps you might make it clearer,&#8221; I prompted.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d rather Duncan did that,&#8221; she replied, using
my husband&#8217;s first name, obviously, without knowing
she had done so.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t it be fairer&mdash;for the two of us&mdash;now?
Wouldn&#8217;t it be cleaner?&#8221; I rather tremulously asked
of her.</p>
<p>She nodded and stared down at the sheet covered
with small columns of figures.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know whether you know it or not,&#8221; she
said with a studied sort of quietness, &#8220;but last week
Mr. McKail began making arrangements to establish
a residence in Nevada. He will have to live there, of
course, for at least six months, perhaps even longer.&#8221;</p>
<p>I could feel this sinking in, like water going
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_353' name='page_353'></a>353</span>
through blotting-paper. The woman at the desk
must have misinterpreted my silence, for she was
moved to say, in a heavier effort at self-defense, &#8220;He
<i>knew</i>, of course, that you cared for some one else.&#8221;</p>
<p>I looked at her, as though she were a thousand
miles away. I stood there impressed by the utter
inadequacy of speech. And the thing that puzzled
me was that there was an air of honesty about the
woman. She still so desperately clung to her self-respect
that she wanted me to understand both her
predicament and her motives. I could hear her explaining
that my husband had no intention of going
to Reno, but would live in Virginia City, where he
was taking up some actual mining interests. Such
things were not pleasant, of course. But this one
could be put through without difficulty. Mr. McKail
had been assured of that.</p>
<p>I tried to pull myself together, wondering why I
should so suddenly feel like a marked woman, a
pariah of the prairies, as friendless and alone as a
leper. Then I thought of my children. And that
cleared my head, like a wind sweeping clean a smoky
room.</p>
<p>&#8220;But a case has to be made out,&#8221; I began. &#8220;It
would have to be proved that I&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_354' name='page_354'></a>354</span></p>
<p>&#8220;There will be no difficulty on that point, Mrs. McKail,&#8221;
went on the other woman as I came to a
stop. &#8220;Provided the suit is not opposed.&#8221;</p>
<p>The significance of that quietly uttered phrase did
not escape me. Our glances met and locked.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are the children,&#8221; I reminded her. And
she looked a very commercialized young lady as she
sat confronting me across her many columns of
figures.</p>
<p>&#8220;There should be no difficulty there&mdash;<i>provided</i> the
suit is not opposed,&#8221; she repeated with the air of a
physician confronted by a hypochondriacal patient.</p>
<p>&#8220;The children are mine,&#8221; I rather foolishly proclaimed,
with my first touch of passion.</p>
<p>&#8220;The children are yours,&#8221; she admitted. And
about her hung an air of authority, of cool reserve,
which I couldn&#8217;t help resenting.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is very generous of you,&#8221; I admitted, not
without ironic intent.</p>
<p>She smiled rather sadly as she sat looking at me.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s something that doesn&#8217;t rest with either of
us,&#8221; she said with the suspicion of a quaver in her
voice. And <i>she</i>, I suddenly remembered, might some
day sit eating her pot of honey on a grave. I realized,
too, that very little was to be gained by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_355' name='page_355'></a>355</span>
prolonging that strangest of interviews. I wanted
quietude in which to think things over. I wanted to
go back to my cell like a prisoner and brood over
my sentence....</p>
<p>And I have thought things over. I at last see the
light. From this day forward there shall be no
vacillating. I am going back to Casa Grande.</p>
<p>I have always hated this house; I have always
hated everything about the place, without having the
courage to admit it. I have done my part, I have
made my effort, and it was a wasted effort. I wasn&#8217;t
even given a chance. And now I shall gather my
things together and go back to my home, to the only
home that remains to me. I shall still have my kiddies.
I shall have my Poppsy and&mdash;But sharp as an
arrow-head the memory of my lost boy strikes into
my heart. My Dinkie is gone. I no longer have him
to make what is left of my life endurable....</p>
<p>It is raining to-night, I notice, steadily and dismally.
It is a dark night, outside, for lost children....</p>
<p>Duncan has just come home, wet and muddy, and
gone up to his room. The gray-faced solemnity with
which he strode past me makes me feel sure that he
has been conversing with his lady-love. But what
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_356' name='page_356'></a>356</span>
difference does it make? What difference does <i>anything</i>
make? In the matter of women, I have just
remembered, what may be one man&#8217;s meat is another
man&#8217;s poison. But I can&#8217;t understand these reversible
people, like house-rugs, who can pretend to love two
ways at once.... I only know one man, in all the
wide world, who has not shattered my faith in his
kind. He is one of those neck-or-nothing men who
never change.</p>
<p>There are many ranchers, out in this country, who
keep what they call a blizzard-line. It&#8217;s a rope that
stretches in winter from their house-door to their
shed or their stable, a rope that keeps them from getting
lost when a blizzard is raging. Peter, I know,
has been my blizzard-line. And in some way, please
God, he will yet lead me back to warmth. He is himself
out there in the cold, accepting it, all the time,
with the same quiet fortitude that a Polar bear
might. But he will thole through, in the end. For
with all his roughness he can be unexpectedly adroit.
Whinstane Sandy once told me something he had
learned about Polar bears in his old Yukon days:
with all their heaviness, they can go where a dog
daren&#8217;t venture. If need be, they can flatten out and
slide over a sheet of ice too thin to support a running
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_357' name='page_357'></a>357</span>
dog. And the drift-ice may be widening, but I refuse
to give up my hope of hope. &#8220;Let the mother go,&#8221;
as the Good Book says, &#8220;that it may be well with
thee!&#8221; ...</p>
<p>I have just remembered that I tried to shoot my
husband once. He may make use of <i>that</i>, when he
gets down to Virginia City. It might, in fact, help
things along very materially. And Susie&#8217;s eyes will
probably pop out, when she reads it in a San Francisco
paper....</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve thought of so many clever things I should have
said to Alsina Teeswater. As I look back, I find it
was the other lady who did about all the talking.
There were old ulcerations to be cleared away, of
course, and I let her talk about the same as you let
a dentist work with his fingers in your mouth....
But now I must go up and make sure my Poppsy is
safely tucked in. I have just opened the door and
looked out. It is storming wretchedly. God pity
any little boys who are abroad on such a night!</p>

<a name='TWO_HOURS_LATER' id='TWO_HOURS_LATER'></a>
<h2><i>Two Hours Later</i></h2>
</div>
<p>It is well past midnight. But there is no sleep this
night for Chaddie McKail. I am too happy to sleep.
I am too happy to act sane. For my boy is safe.
<i>Peter has found my Dinkie!</i></p>
<p>I was called to the telephone, a little after eleven,
but couldn&#8217;t hear well on the up-stairs extension, so
I went to the instrument down-stairs, where the
operator told me it was long-distance, from Buckhorn.
So I listened, with my heart in my mouth. But
all I could get was a buzz and crackle and an occasional
ghostly word. It was the storm, I suppose.
Then I heard Peter&#8217;s voice, thin and faint and far
away, but most unmistakably Peter&#8217;s voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you hear me now?&#8221; he said, like a man speaking
from the bottom of the sea.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; I called back. &#8220;What is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Get ready for good news,&#8221; said that thin but
valorous voice that seemed to be speaking from the
tip-top mountains of Mars. But the crackling and
burring cut us off again. Then something must have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_359' name='page_359'></a>359</span>
happened to the line, or we must have been switched
to a better circuit. For, the next moment, Peter&#8217;s
voice seemed almost in the next room. It seemed to
come closer at a bound, like a shore-line when you
look at it through a telescope.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that any better?&#8221; he asked through his miles
and miles of rain-swept blackness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I can hear you plainly now,&#8221; I told him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, yes, that <i>is</i> better,&#8221; he acknowledged. &#8220;And
everything else is, too, my dear. For I&#8217;ve found your
Dinkie and&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve found Dinkie?&#8221; I gasped.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have, thank God. And he&#8217;s safe and sound!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221; I demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fast asleep at Alabama Ranch.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is he all right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As fit as a fiddle&mdash;all he wants is sleep.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Oh, Peter!</i>&#8221; It was foolish. But it was all I
could say for a full minute. For my boy was alive,
and safe. My laddie had been found by Peter&mdash;by
good old Peter, who never, in the time of need, was
known to fail me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are you now?&#8221; I asked, when reason was
once more on her throne.</p>
<p>&#8220;At Buckhorn,&#8221; answered Peter.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_360' name='page_360'></a>360</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And you went all that way through the mud and
rain, just to tell me?&#8221; I said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had to, or I&#8217;d blow up!&#8221; acknowledged Peter.
&#8220;And now I&#8217;d like to know what you want me to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want you to come and get me, Peter,&#8221; I said
slowly and distinctly over the wire.</p>
<p>There was a silence of several seconds.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you understand what that means?&#8221; he finally
demanded. His voice, I noticed, had become suddenly
solemn.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Peter, I understand,&#8221; I told him. &#8220;Please
come and get me!&#8221; And again the silence was so prolonged
that I had to cut in and ask: &#8220;Are you
there?&#8221;</p>
<p>And Peter&#8217;s voice answered &#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you&#8217;ll come?&#8221; I exacted, determined to burn
all my bridges behind me.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be there on Monday,&#8221; said Peter, with quiet
decision. &#8220;I&#8217;ll be there with Tithonus and Tumble-Weed
and the old prairie-schooner. And we&#8217;ll all
trek home together!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Skookum!</i>&#8221; I said with altogether unbecoming
levity.</p>
<p>I patted the telephone instrument as I hung up the
receiver. Then I sat staring at it in a brown study.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_361' name='page_361'></a>361</span></p>
<p>Then I went careening up-stairs and woke Poppsy
out of a sound sleep and hugged her until her bones
were ready to crack and told her that our Dinkie had
been found again. And Poppsy, not being quite able
to get it through her sleepy little head, promptly
began to bawl. But there was little to bawl over, once
she was thoroughly awake. And then I went careening
down to the telephone again, and called up
Lossie&#8217;s boarding-house, and had her landlady root
the poor girl out of bed, and heard <i>her</i> break down
and have a little cry when I told her our Dinkie had
been found. And the first thing she asked me, when
she was able to talk again, was if Gershom Binks had
been told of the good news. And I had to acknowledge
that I hadn&#8217;t even <i>thought</i> of poor old Gershom,
but that Peter Ketley would surely have passed the
good word on to Casa Grande, for Peter always
seemed to think of the right thing.</p>
<p>And then I remembered about Duncan. For Duncan,
whatever he may have been, was still the boy&#8217;s
father. And he must be told. It was my duty to tell
him. So once more I climbed the stairs, but this
time more slowly. I had to wait a full minute before
I found the courage, I don&#8217;t know why, to knock
on Duncan&#8217;s bedroom door.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_362' name='page_362'></a>362</span></p>
<p>I knocked twice before any answer came.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; asked the familiar sleepy <i>bass</i>&mdash;and
I realized what gulfs yawned between us when my
husband on one side of that closed door could be
lying lost in slumber and I on the other side of it
could find life doing such unparalleled things to me.
I felt for him as a girl home, tired from her first
dance, feels for a young brother asleep beside a
Noah&#8217;s Ark.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; I heard Duncan&#8217;s voice repeating
from the bed.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s me,&#8221; I rather weakly proclaimed.</p>
<p>&#8220;What has happened?&#8221; was the question that came
after a moment&#8217;s silence.</p>
<p>I leaned with my face against the painted door-panel.
It was smooth and cool and pleasant to press
one&#8217;s skin against.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve found Dinkie,&#8221; I said. I could hear the
squeak of springs as my husband sat up in bed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is he all right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, he&#8217;s all right,&#8221; I said with a great sigh. And
I listened for an answering sigh from the other side
of the door.</p>
<p>But instead of that Duncan&#8217;s voice asked: &#8220;Where
is he?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_363' name='page_363'></a>363</span></p>
<p>&#8220;At Alabama Ranch,&#8221; I said, without realizing
what that acknowledgment meant. And again a brief
period of silence intervened.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who found him?&#8221; asked my husband, in a hardened
voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Peter Ketley,&#8221; I said, in as collected a voice as I
could manage. And this time the significance of the
silence did not escape me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then your cup of happiness ought to be full,&#8221; I
heard the voice on the other side of the door remark
with heavy deliberateness. I stood there with my
face leaning against the cool panel.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is,&#8221; I said with a quiet audacity which surprised
me almost as much as it must have surprised
the man on the bed a million miles away from me.</p>

<h2><i>Sunday the Eighth</i></h2>
</div>
<p>How different is life from what the fictioneers
would paint it! How hopelessly mixed-up and
macaronic, how undignified in what ought to be its
big moments and how pompous in so many of its
pettinesses!</p>
<p>I told my husband to-day that Poppsy and I were
going back to Casa Grande. And that, surely, ought
to have been the Big Moment in the career of an
unloved invertebrate. But the situation declined to
take off, as the airmen say.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess that means it&#8217;s about time we got unscrambled,&#8221;
the man I had once married and lived
with quietly remarked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wasn&#8217;t that your intention?&#8221; I just as quietly
inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve had forced on me,&#8221; he retorted,
with a protective hardening of the Holbein-Astronomer
jaw-line.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; was all I could find to say.</p>
<p>He turned to the window and stared out at his big
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_365' name='page_365'></a>365</span>
white iron fountain set in his terraced lawn behind
his endless cobble-stone walls. I couldn&#8217;t tell, of
course, what he was thinking about. But I myself
was thinking of the past, the irrecoverable past, the
irredeemable past, the singing years of my womanly
youth that seemed to be sealed in a lowered coffin on
which the sheltering earth would soon be heaped, on
which the first clods were already dropping with hollow
sounds. We each seemed afraid to look the other
full in the eyes. So we armored ourselves, as poor
mortals must do, in the helmets of pretended diffidence
and the breast-plates of impersonality.</p>
<p>&#8220;How are you going back?&#8221; my husband finally
inquired. Whatever ghosts it had been necessary to
lay, I could see, he had by this time laid. He no
longer needed to stare out at the white iron fountain
of which he was so proud.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve sent for the prairie-schooner,&#8221; I told him.</p>
<p>His flush of anger rather startled me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t that impress you as rather cheaply
theatrical?&#8221; he demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;I fancy it will be very comfortable,&#8221; I told him,
without looking up. I&#8217;d apparently been attributing
to him feelings which, after all, were not so desolating
as I might have wished.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_366' name='page_366'></a>366</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Every one to his own taste,&#8221; he observed as he
called rather sharply to Tokudo to bring him his
humidor. Then he took out a cigar and lighted it
and ordered the car. And that was the lee and the
long of it. That was the way we faced our Great
Divide, our forked trail that veered off East and
West into infinity!</p>

<h2><i>Thursday the Eleventh</i></h2>
</div>
<p>The trek is over. And it was not one of triumph.
For we find ourselves, sometimes, in deeper water
than we imagine. Then we have to choke and gasp
for a while before we can get our breath back.</p>
<p>Peter, in the first place, didn&#8217;t appear with the
prairie-schooner. He left that to come later in the
day, with Whinnie and Struthers. He appeared quite
early Monday morning, with fire in his eye, and with
a demand to see the master of the house. Heaven
knows what he had heard, or how he had heard it.
But the two men were having it hot and heavy when
I felt it was about time for me to step into the room.
To be quite frank, I had not expected any such outburst
from Duncan. I knew his feelings were not
involved, and where you have a vacuum it is impossible,
of course, to have an explosion. I interpreted
his resentment as a show of opposition to save his
face. But I was wrong. And I was wrong about
Peter. That mild-eyed man is no plaster saint. He
can fight, if he&#8217;s goaded into it, and fight like a bulldog.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_368' name='page_368'></a>368</span>
He was saying a few plain truths to Duncan,
when I stepped into the room, a few plain truths
which took the color out of the Dour Man&#8217;s face and
made him shake with anger.</p>
<p>&#8220;For two cents,&#8221; Duncan was rather childishly
shouting at him, &#8220;I&#8217;d fill you full of lead!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Try it!&#8221; said Peter, who wasn&#8217;t any too steady
himself. &#8220;Try it, and you&#8217;d at least end up with
doing something in the open!&#8221;</p>
<p>Duncan studied him, like a prize-fighter studying
his waiting opponent.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a cheap actor,&#8221; he finally announced.
&#8220;This sort of thing isn&#8217;t settled that way, and you
know it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And it&#8217;s not going to be settled the way you
intended,&#8221; announced Peter Ketley.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you know about my intentions?&#8221; demanded
Duncan.</p>
<p>&#8220;Much more than you imagine,&#8221; retorted Peter.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve got your record, McKail, and I&#8217;ve had it for
three years. I&#8217;ve stood by, until now; but the time
has come when I&#8217;m going to have a hand in this thing.
And you&#8217;re not going to get your freedom by dragging
this woman&#8217;s name through a divorce-court. If
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_369' name='page_369'></a>369</span>
there&#8217;s any dragging to be done, it&#8217;s your carcass
that&#8217;s going to be tied to the tail-board!&#8221;</p>
<p>Duncan stood studying him with a face cheese-colored
with hate.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you rather double-crossing yourself?&#8221; he
mocked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not thinking about myself,&#8221; said Peter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then what&#8217;s prompting all the heroics?&#8221; demanded
Duncan.</p>
<p>&#8220;For two years and more, McKail,&#8221; Peter cried
out as he stepped closer to the other man, &#8220;you&#8217;ve
given this woman a pretty good working idea of hell.
And I&#8217;ve seen enough of it. It&#8217;s going to end. It&#8217;s
got to end. But it&#8217;s not going to end the way you&#8217;ve
so neatly figured out!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then how do you propose to end it?&#8221; Duncan
demanded, with a sort of second-wind of composure.
But his face was still colorless.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll see when the time comes,&#8221; retorted Peter.</p>
<p>&#8220;You may have rather a long wait,&#8221; taunted
Duncan.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have waited a number of years,&#8221; answered the
other man, with a dignity which sent a small thrill up
and down my spine. &#8220;And I can wait a number of
years more if I have to.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_370' name='page_370'></a>370</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We all knew, of course, that you were waiting,&#8221;
sneered my husband.</p>
<p>Peter turned to fling back an answer to that, but
I stepped between them. I was tired of being haggled
over, like marked-down goods on a bargain-counter.
I was tired of being a passive agent before forces
that seemed stripping me of my last shred of dignity.
I was tired of the shoddiness of the entire shoddy
situation.</p>
<p>And I told them so. I told them I&#8217;d no intention of
being bargained over, and that I&#8217;d had rather enough
of men for the rest of my natural life, and if Duncan
wanted his freedom he was at liberty to take it without
the slightest opposition from me. And I said a
number of other things, which I have no wish either
to remember or record. But it resulted in Duncan
staring at me in a resurrection-plant sort of way,
and in Peter rather dolorously taking his departure.
I wanted to call him back, but I couldn&#8217;t carpenter
together any satisfactory excuse for his coming back,
and I couldn&#8217;t see any use in it.</p>
<p>So instead of journeying happily homeward in the
cavernous old prairie-schooner, I felt a bit ridiculous
as Tokudo impassively carried our belongings out to
the canvas-covered wagon and Poppsy and I climbed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_371' name='page_371'></a>371</span>
aboard. The good citizens of American Hill stared
after us as we rumbled down through the neatly
boulevarded streets, and I felt suspiciously like a
gypsy-queen who&#8217;d been politely requested by the
local constabulary to move on.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t until we reached the open country that
my spirits revived. Then the prairie seemed to reach
out its hand to me and give me peace. We camped,
that first night, in the sheltering arm of a little coul&eacute;e
threaded by a tiny stream. We cooked bacon and
eggs and coffee while Whinnie out-spanned his team
and put up his tent.</p>
<p>I sat on an oat-sack, after supper, with Poppsy
between my knees, watching the evening stars come
out. They were worlds, I remembered, some of them
worlds perhaps with sorrowing men and women on
them. And they seemed very lonely and far-away
worlds, until I heard the drowsy voice of my Poppsy
say up through the dusk: &#8220;In two days more,
Mummy, we&#8217;ll be back to Dinkie, won&#8217;t we?&#8221;</p>
<p>And there was much, I remembered, for which a
mother should be thankful.</p>

<h2><i>Sunday the Fourteenth</i></h2>
</div>
<p><i>Dark, and true, and tender is the North.</i> Heaven
bless the rhymster who first penned those words.
Spring is stealing hack to the prairie, and our world
is a world of beauty. The sky to-day is windrowed
with flat-bottomed cumulus-clouds, tier beyond tier
above a level plane of light, marking off the infinite
distance like receding mile-stones on a world turned
over on its back. Occasionally the outstretched head
of a wild duck, pumping north with a black throb of
wings, melts away to a speck in the opaline air. Back
among the muskeg reeds the waders are courting and
chattering, and early this morning I heard the
plaintive winnowing call-note of the Wilson snipe, and
later the <i>punk-e-lunk</i> love-cry of a bittern to his
mate. There&#8217;s an eagle planing in lazy circles high
in the air, even now, putting a soft-pedal on the noise
of the coots and grebes as he circles over their rush-lined
cabarets. And somewhere out on the range a
bull is lowing. It is the season of love and the season
of happiness. Dinkie and Poppsy and I are going
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_373' name='page_373'></a>373</span>
out to gather prairie-crocuses. They are thick now
in the prairie-sod, soft blue and lavender and sometimes
mauve. We must dance to the vernal saraband
while we can: Spring is so short in this norland country
of ours. It comes late. But as Peter says, A
late spring never deceives....</p>
<p>I thought I had offended Peter for life. But when
he appeared late this afternoon and I asked him why
he had kept away from me, he said these first few
days naturally belonged to Dinkie and he&#8217;d been busy
studying marsh-birds. He looked rather rumpled
and muddy, and impressed me as a man sadly in need
of a woman to look after his things.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s ride,&#8221; said Peter. &#8220;I want to talk to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>I was afraid of that talk, but I was more afraid
something might happen to interfere with it. So I
changed into my old riding-duds and put on my
weather-stained old sombrero and we saddled Buntie
and Laughing-Gas and went loping off over the sun-washed
prairie with our shadows behind us.</p>
<p>We rode a long way before Peter said anything. I
wanted to be happy, but I wasn&#8217;t quite able to be. I
tried to think of neither the past nor the future, but
there were too many ghosts of other days loping
along the trail beside us.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_374' name='page_374'></a>374</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What are you going to do?&#8221; Peter finally inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;About what?&#8221; I temporized as he pulled up beside
me.</p>
<p>&#8220;About everything,&#8221; he ungenerously responded.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what to do, Peter,&#8221; I had to acknowledge.
&#8220;I&#8217;m like a barrel without hoops. I
want to stick together, but one more thump will
surely send me to pieces!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then why not get the hoops around?&#8221; suggested
Peter.</p>
<p>&#8220;But where will I get the hoops?&#8221; I asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here,&#8221; he said. He was, I noticed, holding out
his arms. And I laughed, even though my heart was
heavy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Men have been a great disappointment to me,
Peter,&#8221; I said with a shake of my sombrero.</p>
<p>&#8220;Try me,&#8221; suggested Peter.</p>
<p>But still again I had to shake my head.</p>
<p>&#8220;That wouldn&#8217;t be fair, Peter,&#8221; I told him. &#8220;I
can&#8217;t spoil your life to see what&#8217;s left of my own
patched up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you&#8217;re going to spoil two of &#8217;em!&#8221; he
promptly asserted.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t believe in that sort of thing,&#8221; I did
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_375' name='page_375'></a>375</span>
my best to explain to him. &#8220;I&#8217;ve had my innings, and
<i>I&#8217;m out</i>. I&#8217;ve a one-way heart, the same as a one-way
street. I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s anything in the
world more odious than promiscuity. That&#8217;s a big
word, but it stands for an even bigger offense against
God. I&#8217;ve always said I intended to be a single-track
woman.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But your track&#8217;s blown up,&#8221; contended Peter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll have to lay me a new one,&#8221; I said with
a fine show of assurance.</p>
<p>&#8220;And do you know where it will lead?&#8221; he demanded,</p>
<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221; I asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Straight to me,&#8221; he said as he studied me with
eyes that were so quiet and kind I could feel a flutter
of my heart-wings.</p>
<p>But still again I shook my head.</p>
<p>&#8220;That would be bringing you nothing but a
withered up old has-been,&#8221; I said with a mock-wail
of misery.</p>
<p>And Peter actually laughed at that.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll be a good ten years before you&#8217;ve even grown
up,&#8221; he retorted. &#8220;And another twenty years before
you&#8217;ve really settled down!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_376' name='page_376'></a>376</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re saying I&#8217;ll never have sense,&#8221; I objected.
&#8220;And I know you&#8217;re right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I love about you,&#8221; averred Peter.</p>
<p>&#8220;What you love about me?&#8221; I demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said with his patient old smile, &#8220;your
imperishable youthfulness, your eternal never-ending
eternity-defying golden-tinted girlishness!&#8221;</p>
<p>A flute began to play in my heart. And I knew
that like Ulysses&#8217;s men I would have to close my ears
to it. But it&#8217;s easier to row past an island than to
run away from your own heart.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know it&#8217;s a lie, Peter, but I love you for saying
it. It makes me want to hug you, and it makes me
want to pirouette, if I wasn&#8217;t on horseback. It
makes my heart sing. But it&#8217;s only the singing of
one lonely little chickadee in the middle of a terribly
big pile of ruins. For that&#8217;s all my life can be now,
just a hopeless smash-up. And you&#8217;re cut out for
something better than a wrecking-car for the rest of
your days.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; protested Peter. &#8220;It&#8217;s <i>you</i> who&#8217;ve got
to save <i>me</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Save you?&#8221; I echoed.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got to give me something to live for, or
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_377' name='page_377'></a>377</span>
I&#8217;ll just rust away in the ditch and never get back to
the rails again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Peter!&#8221; I cried.</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not playing fair. You&#8217;re trying to make
me pity you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, don&#8217;t you?&#8221; demanded Peter.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would if I saw you sacrificing your life for a
woman with a crazy-quilt past.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not thinking of the past,&#8221; asserted Peter,
&#8220;I&#8217;m thinking of the future.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just it,&#8221; I tried to explain. &#8220;I&#8217;ll have to
face that future with a clouded name. I&#8217;ll be a
divorced woman. Ugh! I always thought of divorced
women as something you wouldn&#8217;t quite care to sit
next to at table. I hate divorce.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a Quaker myself,&#8221; acknowledged Peter. &#8220;But
I occasionally think of what Cobbett once said: &#8216;I
don&#8217;t much like weasels. Yet I hate rats. Therefore
I say success to the weasels!&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see what weasels have to do with it,&#8221; I
complained.</p>
<p>&#8220;Putting one&#8217;s house in order again may sometimes
be as beneficent as surgery,&#8221; contended Peter.</p>
<p>&#8220;And sometimes as painful,&#8221; I added.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_378' name='page_378'></a>378</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yet there&#8217;s no mistake like not cleaning up old
mistakes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I hate it,&#8221; I told him. &#8220;It all seems so&mdash;so
cheap.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;On the contrary,&#8221; corrected Peter, &#8220;it&#8217;s rather
costly.&#8221; He pulled up across my path and made me
come to a stop. &#8220;My dear,&#8221; he said, very solemn
again, &#8220;I know the stuff you&#8217;re made of. I know
you&#8217;ve got to climb to the light by a path of your
own choosing. And you have to see the light with
your own eyes. But I&#8217;m willing to wait. I <i>have</i>
waited, a very long time. But there&#8217;s one fact you&#8217;ve
got to face: I love you too much ever to dream of
giving you up.&#8221;</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think either of us moved for a full moment.
The flute was singing so loud in my heart that I was
afraid of myself. And, woman-like, I backed away
from the thing I wanted.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not <i>me</i>, Peter, I must remember now. It&#8217;s my
bairns. I&#8217;ve two bairns to bring up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got the three of you to bring up,&#8221; maintained
Peter. And that made us both sit silent for another
moment or two.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not that simple,&#8221; I finally said, though Peter
smiled guardedly at my ghost of a smile.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_379' name='page_379'></a>379</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It would be if you cared for me as much as Dinkie
does,&#8221; he said with quite unnecessary solemnity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Peter, I do, I do,&#8221; I cried out as the memory
of all I owed him surged mistily through my mind.
&#8220;But a gray hair is something you can&#8217;t joke away.
And I&#8217;ve got five of them, right here over my left ear.
I found them, months ago. And they&#8217;re there to
stay!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How about my bald spot?&#8221; demanded my oppressor
and my deliverer rolled into one.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s a bald spot compared to a bob-cat of a
temper like mine?&#8221; I challenged, remembering how
I&#8217;d once heard a revolver-hammer snap in my husband&#8217;s
face.</p>
<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s your spirit I like,&#8221; maintained the unruffled
Peter.</p>
<p>&#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t always,&#8221; I reminded him.</p>
<p>Yet he merely looked at me with his trust-me-and-test-me
expression.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll chance it!&#8221; he said, after a quite contented
moment or two of meditative silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;But don&#8217;t you see,&#8221; I went forlornly arguing on,
&#8220;it mustn&#8217;t be a chance. That&#8217;s something people of
our age can never afford to take.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Peter, at that, for some reason I couldn&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_380' name='page_380'></a>380</span>
fathom, began to wag his head. He did it slowly and
lugubriously, like a man who inspects a road he has
no liking for. But at the same time, apparently, he
was finding it hard to tuck away a small smile of
triumph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we must never see each other again,&#8221; he
solemnly asserted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Peter!&#8221; I cried.</p>
<p>&#8220;I must go away, at once,&#8221; he meditatively observed.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Peter!</i>&#8221; I said again, with the flute turning into
a pair of ice-tongs that clamped into the corners of
my heart.</p>
<p>&#8220;Far, far away,&#8221; he continued as he studiously
avoided my eye. &#8220;For there will be safety now only
in flight.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Safety from what?&#8221; I demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;From you,&#8221; retorted Peter.</p>
<p>&#8220;But what will happen to <i>me</i>, if you do that?&#8221; I
heard my own voice asking as Buntie started to paw
the prairie-floor and I did my level best to fight down
the black waves of desolation that were half-drowning
me. &#8220;What&#8217;ll there be to hold me up, when you&#8217;re
the only man in all this world who can keep my barrel
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_381' name='page_381'></a>381</span>
of happiness from going slap-bang to pieces?
What&#8211;&#8211;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Verboten!</i>&#8221; interrupted Peter. But that solemn-soft
smile of his gathered me in and covered me, very
much as the rumpled feathers of a mother-bird cover
her young, her crazily twittering and crazily wandering
young who never know their own mind.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;ll happen to me,&#8221; I went desperately on,
&#8220;when you&#8217;re the only man alive who understands this
crazy old heart of mine, when you&#8217;ve taught me to
hitch the last of my hope on the one unselfish man
I&#8217;ve ever known?&#8221;</p>
<p>This seemed to trouble Peter. But only remotely,
as the lack of grammar in the Lord&#8217;s Prayer might
affect a Holy Roller. He insisted, above all things,
on being judicial.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll have to come back, I suppose,&#8221; he finally
admitted, &#8220;for Dinkie&#8217;s sake.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why for Dinkie&#8217;s sake?&#8221; I asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because some day, my dear, our Dinkie is going
to be a great man. And I want to have a hand in
fashioning that greatness.&#8221;</p>
<p>I sat looking at the red ball of the sun slipping
down behind the shoulder of the world. A wind came
out of the North, cool and sweet and balsamic with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_382' name='page_382'></a>382</span>
hope. I heard a loon cry. And then the earth was
still again.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>We&#8217;ll be waiting</i>,&#8221; I said, with a tear of happiness
tickling the bridge of my nose. And then, so that
Peter might not see still another loon crying, I swung
Buntie sharply about on the trail. And we rode
home, side by side, through the twilight.</p>
